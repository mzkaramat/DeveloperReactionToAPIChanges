2018-07-05 10:39:40,Show HN: Generate your og:images automatically,"Hello Hacker-Newsers!<p>I’m Armin, co-maker of Placid. We deliver Social Images as a Service: Placid lets you generate nice Share Images for Twitter and Facebook via our API. (And more Social Image Formats soon!)<p>Here’s how it works:<p>1) Choose a preset design from our library.<p>2) Customize your template with default values for colors, text, photos &#x2F; logos.<p>3) Integrate the meta tags into your project.<p>4) Change parameters of the Image URL in the meta tag to dynamically fill elements of the template. You can f.ex. generate your blog article’s title on to the image or fill a browser window with a screenshot of a website.<p>We started building Placid as a tool to automate Social Image Generation for our own projects and we figured it’s something that other people could use too. For now, we concentrated on providing Meta Images, but we’re already testing Placid for other use cases, like generated Pinterest Images. So we’ll soon add:<p>* An editor to create templates from scratch (and with custom Image Dimensions)<p>* More options to customize Presets<p>* More Presets (also for Instagram Posts and Stories, Pinterest Pins, Facebook Posts,..)<p>We’d love your feedback and suggestions for missing features or preset options :)<p>Armin",Twitter
2018-07-05 05:34:26,Itty Bitty: Sites contained within their own links,"I don&#x27;t follow. I have a Twitter profile. If someone else shares racist stuff on their Twitter profile, is it &quot;on my domain?&quot;<p>In any case, I&#x27;m skeptical that you would ever use this for a blog because the links are immutable. You&#x27;d have to either change your homepage every time you updated your blog, or you&#x27;d have to dynamically render your homepage in Javascript by querying another server - and if you&#x27;re gonna do that, what&#x27;s the point? Just host your own stuff then.<p>What this gives you is a way to share static content where your entire app&#x2F;page can be distributed in the url with extremely minimal server interaction. There&#x27;s no risk of malware or vandalism because there&#x27;s nothing actually being hosted - the URL <i>is</i> the data. When you share it with someone you know exactly what they&#x27;re going to see when they click on it.<p>I can think of a lot of uses I might have for this; even just minor things like sharing quick lists with family members. Updating the URL whenever I changed something would be annoying, but the benefits might outweigh the drawbacks.<p><i>Edit: Are you talking about domain forwarding? I could see how that would be problematic. It didn&#x27;t occur me because I&#x27;m not sure what the advantage would be. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been in a situation where it was too cumbersome for me to host static content somewhere, but not too cumbersome for me to buy a domain and edit its config whenever I published content.</i>",Twitter
2018-07-03 01:29:50,Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid is a platform designed to re-decentralize the web,"There are two closely intertwined but separate issues: centralization and governance.<p>Current web technology typically sees one entity controlling the data; if you sign up for a website, your data goes in their database.  That&#x27;s due to the common stack we all build on: some form of API&#x2F;web server, some form of SQL&#x2F;NoSQL database, some form of client.  If we had a world where developers could simply and freely implement services on top of a <i>different</i> paradigm, we&#x27;d stop having to worry about big central entities like Facebook, Google, your local computer store, whoever -- being able to sell your data.  They simply wouldn&#x27;t have it.  I&#x27;m not sure what that paradigm is, but IPFS, Secure Scuttlebutt, Solid, the Dat Project etc. are all interesting takes on what a solution to that problem might look like.<p>At the other end of the spectrum is governance, which is something sorely lacking, and allows these misinformation campaigns to spread so freely.  Do we still have to worry about governance in a world where we own our own data?  Yes, probably, if the surge of illegal and genuinely nasty content like Child Pornography on the new big distributed networks (eg. ZeroNet) is any indicator.  Censorship is a spectrum, and while I can appreciate sticking to the view that free speech is best for all, there are some behaviours which society has mostly agreed are objectionable.<p>The current paradigm of each social service provider essentially being a self-determining fiefdom isn&#x27;t too dissimilar to how humaity&#x27;s always done things, I guess (for instance, different pubs&#x2F;bars will have differing clienteles and degrees of socially acceptable behaviour), except for the scale -- which unfortunately probably does merit a change in how our current major sites are run (YouTube and Twitter in particular seem like they&#x27;ve been gamed incredibly well by cynical parties).  I don&#x27;t know how we solve this problem, but better technical underpinnings might make this a simpler problem to solve.  Independently, however, I note that there are places like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.coop</a> where they&#x27;re trying to take that problem on head-first.<p>It will be interesting to see what the next few years of the internet look like.  My hope is that we see some of the people interested in this problem start focussing on normal people instead of other techies; suggesting to my friends that they move to Secure Scuttlebutt is pretty hard, as the majority of them really only use their phones (or tablets).<p>Personally, I think something that tied together messaging and an event invitation&#x2F;calendaring system would take a <i>massive</i> knock out of the people who are only hanging onto Facebook for those two things, but that&#x27;s still a techy view of &quot;kill centralisation&quot; and not a social view of &quot;how does that new platform get governed?&quot;.",Twitter

Especially good for content which changes infrequently (a few times a day rather than many times a minute).<p>Static site generators typically make it simple to publish a structured data view like a JSON or XML feed of content alongside content pages as HTML (such a bonus!), but it is interesting to see that you&#x27;ve separated the API generation entirely as a Hugo build.

Meaning first party API access is seen as preferable because HTML scraping is unreliable and therefore necessitates a full time staff of individuals to respond to site changes.<p>But if the price is high enough, couldn&#x27;t a third party operating out of another part of the world undercut them using scraping, a dedicated team, and a clean API? Twitter may have technical remedies but it is unlikely they&#x27;d have legal ones outside of the US and a few Western countries.<p>Official APIs Vs. &quot;pirate&quot; APIs haven&#x27;t really been a major issue until now because companies simply weren&#x27;t charging enough to make the alternative cost effective.

2018-05-14 23:30:19,Favstar will shut down as a result of Twitter’s API changes for data streams,"There was a point in time, around 5 years ago more or less, when third party twitter clients were driving a fair amount of innovation in desktop UI, particularly on OSX. As a mentor I&#x27;d even ask if my mentee would want to learn to code by pulling some stuff out of Twitter and putting it in their own design on their own webpage. There was a lot of hope and promise back then, and Twitter was giving a voice to people in harsh regimes as their other modes of contact were being shut down (like with Arab Spring). They looked like they were on the up and up.<p>I don&#x27;t think moves like this solve Twitter&#x27;s existential abuse problem, which I believe has far more to do with their 140 characters and unsolicited heckling than it does anything else. It turns your whole reality into gossip and this gossip overpowers any semblance of rational or reasoned discourse.

2018-05-03 06:14:09,Proton Native – React Native for the desktop,"&gt; I&#x27;m aware of that–that&#x27;s why I said it is possible that you can do it from JavaScript. What I&#x27;m saying is that the JavaScript layer generally causes issues like this, because UINavigationController only works in specific cases. For example, scrolling only works if you&#x27;re a singular top-level scroll view. Getting the titles to animate only works if you don&#x27;t try to modify it after the fact. Putting a button in the navigation bar&#x27;s title view just makes it mess up when it runs its first layout pass. A lot of frameworks end up doing this, or making it very easy for this to occur, so you end up with &quot;broken&quot; navigation of the likes seen in that GIF. Of course, it&#x27;s not unusable, so those who aren&#x27;t as familiar with how it should work don&#x27;t notice the difference.<p>Most of those issues that you bring up with UINavigationController are, while annoying, not actually _that_ common in apps, and people run into them at the native level too - it&#x27;s not entirely a JS issue. Provided you&#x27;re not doing anything too against the grain (which the Wix API more or less protects novice users from doing), you&#x27;re unlikely to experience too many issues and it functions as an almost completely indistinguishable UINavigationController experience for pretty much everyone.<p>As an aside, if React Native would fix TouchableOpacity to follow platform convention, most people would have difficulty detecting RN apps.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m surprised you haven&#x27;t drawn the cynical conclusion from this: that I&#x27;m desperately trying to keep my skills relevant in a world where they&#x27;re being increasingly obsoleted...<p>I didn&#x27;t draw that conclusion, you&#x27;re correct - but had it been the case, I really wouldn&#x27;t have blamed you. I prefer writing [UI|App]Kit day to day and I&#x27;d hate to not be able to. I&#x27;m more than capable in... just about any programming ecosystem, but they&#x27;re simply not as enjoyable for reasons that are tough to put into words.<p>&gt;Wait, are you really telling me to stop &quot;putting down&quot; non-native projects?<p>No, not at all. I put down Qt all the time myself, but then again, how do you define native? ;)<p>My point here is that coming into these threads and saying that people should be building native iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;etc is a bit of a rough sell, given how nuanced actually developing at the native level for those platforms is (e.g, most people wouldn&#x27;t know that a UITableView section header is really a grouped row in NSTableView - AppKit is woefully undocumented and cobweb filled in 2018). Apple needs to get their shit together, and maybe that&#x27;s what Marzipan or whatever is - in fact, I really hope it is.<p>Until then, there&#x27;s simply no compelling reason to build native [UI|App]Kit when the writing is on the walls. Instead of fighting this battle, people need to complain (loudly, very loudly) to Apple. Electron &amp; co are not taking over because they&#x27;re inherently better as an approach, but because native platforms are literally just rolling over.<p>&gt;it&#x27;s developers who need to realize that the user is important<p>This is idealism, and I applaud you for it, but it&#x27;s honestly misplaced (and I wish it wasn&#x27;t). The user is only important _when you actually have users_. For most apps these days, time to market and getting it out the door trumps whatever perceived native benefits there are.<p>I personally build for quality in my projects because it&#x27;s what I want representing me, and that&#x27;s sadly about the only justifiable reason these days.<p>&gt;Sorry, I&#x27;m not on Twitter, so I&#x27;m not aware of what you&#x27;re talking about here. Could you provide more context?<p>Was a bunch of hubbub recently over this article (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inessential.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;youre_practically_a_mac_developer"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inessential.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;youre_practically_a_mac_de...</a>), where it boiled down to Xcode&#x2F;Apple-ecosystem developers decrying alternative approaches (Electron, RN, etc), and more or less saying that it should be easy to just reuse the same stuff for a Mac app. The argument that most non-Xcode&#x2F;Apple-ecosystem devs made was that Apple:<p>- Really, really sucks when it comes to Mac&#x2F;AppKit documentation these days, and discoverability in comparison to the likes of JS and such is nowhere near the same.<p>- Live reload &gt; compile and run, Swift playgrounds aren&#x27;t a solution.<p>- [Almost any JS unit testing framework] &gt; Unit testing in Xcode<p>The tl;dr = Apple is getting off relatively easily for not keeping their dev environments competitive, and people complaining about Electron &amp; co making inroads should really be complaining at Apple for neglecting this stuff. I tend to agree, as noted earlier... and, hell, it&#x27;s not even limited to the above points.<p>For example:<p>- Why the hell are the Apple forums not scrapped and dumped into a hosted StackExchange? It&#x27;s 2018.<p>- Why the hell is Radar still a black hole of information? There are better ways to do this nowadays.<p>- Why the hell is so much of Cocoa &amp; AppKit completely un-Google-able? Half the time you try to find something, you wind up in an archived email thread from the early 2000s. There is no way a new developer is going to put up with this crap in 2018. Shit, if it wasn&#x27;t for NSHipster transcribing WWDC videos we&#x27;d still be sitting there watching video content just to understand a programming ecosystem.<p>- Why the hell does every Cocoa&#x2F;AppKit dev put all their stuff on Twitter these days? They&#x27;re just as responsible as Apple at this point. The JS community documents the everloving bajeezus out of their projects, whereas the only mention you&#x27;d find about, say, NSCollectionView frame&#x2F;bounds change notifications is on Twitter. Nothing from Twitter is easily found in Google.<p>- This list could go on - e.g, why the hell are we _still_ dealing with Cells in AppKit for things like a TextField? We got rid of them for NSTableView, fix the rest already.<p>What&#x27;s really painful about all of this is also that Apple is clearly capable of doing better - Swift alone is a massive improvement in how they&#x27;ve communicated, built, and shipped a developer oriented product. People not holding them accountable and instead expecting the developer community to bend over backwards and build for an aging platform is insanity, especially when this is the most valuable company in the world that we&#x27;re discussing.<p>* = Edits are formatting attempts, because... well, this is another platform that could modernize a bit.",Twitter
2018-04-27 11:06:23,"Two Koreas Agree to End War This Year, Pursue Denuclearization","From the Guardian, which can&#x27;t be accused of being a Trump lover:<p>&gt; This system of indoctrination and propaganda complicates any official announcement of the Trump meeting.

2018-04-23 14:10:44,A helpful view on blockchain from Union Square Ventures,"Amazon is too big of an example. But look at Filecoin.

Obviously, thousands of people calling someone an ape is a problem. But one that is easily avoided by disabling twitter replies to your account. So it’s not a problem for anyone that it happens to.<p>So when I say “I don’t think this is a problem” I mean that it’s not a problem that can’t currently be solved and not worthy of trying to stop the thousand assholes.<p>It’s not blaming the victim to point out that if you change a setting you save them from pain. It’s not Leslie Jones fault at all that people are jerks. But maybe she didn’t know how to configure twitter. If so, wouldn’t it be a shame that if no one wanted to help her learn for fear of victim blaming?<p>I equate this as worrying if people are sitting in their living room gossiping about you and saying mean things. Somehow you have the magic ability to listen in. You do and are upset. Certainly you can try to make those people stop being jerks. Or you can stop listening. Or maybe do both.<p>The problems seem solvable if your goal is to not encounter jerks harassing you online. Since you can filter them out. If your goal is to not have jerks, then definitely not solvable. But that’s a stupid problem to solve through authority. The way you solve jerks is through love and education.",Twitter

2018-02-20 19:06:58,Twitter and the Internet War,"I am not a coder by any means, but I am a heavy social media user and know a lot about politics, sociology, psych, organizing, health, comms---and I admit, until I read this thread, I liked this article because it gave me a better reason for all the screw ups, beyond, &quot;The Executives are dithering and have no business skills and social skills.&quot; Or the theory &quot;The Executives do nothing because they don&#x27;t care if women and vulnerable people die.&quot; Which is far more disturbing....it can&#x27;t be true, even if it <i>feels</i> true.
I would give anything if they&#x27;d listen to users who have been around awhile. So few people worked there and also used it at the same time. (And users longingly miss the Fail Whale logo...)
As a user (250,000+ tweets) under a pseudonym, twitter has incredible uses, things Facebook and other platforms didn&#x27;t do, because they were so closed and hard to search. They created echo Chambers, because you could only see people you already knew or were slightly connected too. Or worse, your mom or mother-in-law could find you. Twitter was so open--if I want to discuss philosophy or Japanese food or an MRI result, 24&#x2F;7 I just search and people who love that are there. And pseudonyms had to exist, because thousands of people in real life have the same name. (just like the rest of the Internet back then and yes, now too) They thought people would just post status updates like, hey eating lunch, but we did way way more. They made it 140 chars with 20 chars reserved for names because many people had expensive tiny data plans, but could update by text message; allowing a much wider demographic to use it, and across multiple countries, even low tech ones with limited access. 
The most critical piece tho is that users invented everything good about twitter (Sorry creators--but we did). TW allowed some html symbols, so a user put an @ in front of a user name to reply, and it worked! Users also invented hashtags, the first one was for organizing BarCamp--which was kind of a conference not about alcohol and the original manual RT, and MT for modified tweet, and commenting on top of  someone&#x27;s tweet, or at the end of it and we figured out how to shrink long urls to post links. bit.ly had no purpose til then, and many users became Developers and got full access to the API and we crowdsourced hundreds of changes and ideas, from pictures to videos to emoji to gifs to analytics, to accessible apps for people with vision, hearing, speech issues. All while making lots and lots of jokes.
They didn&#x27;t start out with a heavy respect for pseudonyms, and privacy, and free speech--but TW learned it fast after the Green Iran Revolution, and after many patient users wanted to keep privacy because they had rare diseases, and mental health issues, and parents of kids with autism and speech issues took to it and found each other and felt less alone. It was less complicated than blogging and writing long stories on laptops after events happened. I could do everything from live tweeting a doctor&#x27;s appt to an ER visit and get reactions from friends who could tell me what to ask. 
We still tweet everything from recipes to exact instructions on how to ride a bike, how to organize groups like #occupy to crowd sourcing Flu symptoms and rashes, to who is watching what TV show and how cool it is to watch live sports &quot;together&quot; even for people who can&#x27;t leave the house that night and meet.
Weekly hour long Chats take place under special hashtags like #hcsm for Health Care Social Media or #meded for medical education. (doctors and science fans and academics found twitter and they debate articles, techniques, crowdsource diagnoses)
Police and emergency responders and good Samaritans have used it to (swear to god, it&#x27;s true) befriend people who sound troubled or suicidal and validate their pain and sadness and find them help.
It is to this day, the only platform I know that allows people from many different areas to find like-minded people and to bring together people across multiple subject areas.
Nothing else does it quite the same way. Especially with the ridiculous algorithms other platforms use.",Twitter

Dan Abramov&#x27;s tweet at [3] describes why React-Redux changed from a render prop to a HOC in the first place, and there&#x27;s another good Twitter discussion thread at [4] (where Michael Jackson points out that this is suddenly a really popular thing to try).<p>Glancing at the source code for this implementation, I&#x27;m actually rather concerned about its performance.  It looks like it calls `connect()` _inside_ of a functional component.  That means that every time React re-renders the parent functional component, `connect()` will generate a new HOC component, React will see that it&#x27;s a different component type being rendered (because the new HOC is not the same as the old HOC), and the entire child component tree will be thrown away by the reconciliation process.  This does not seem like a very performant approach.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;react-redux&#x2F;tree&#x2F;11adf721fbb3f5548c6e5f6b4999835d41807850#deprecated-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;react-redux&#x2F;tree&#x2F;11adf721fbb3f554...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jsonnull&#x2F;redux-render"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jsonnull&#x2F;redux-render</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@gott&#x2F;connecting-react-component-to-redux-store-with-render-callback-53fd044bb42b"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@gott&#x2F;connecting-react-component-to-redux...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;913712295594926080"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;913712295594926080</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mjackson&#x2F;status&#x2F;915335846324092930"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mjackson&#x2F;status&#x2F;915335846324092930</a>",Twitter

2017-10-02 12:12:09,Does Even Mark Zuckerberg Know What Facebook Is?,"For the record: What Facebook is and wants to be is actually an <i>enforceable personal relations layer</i> on top of the web stack.<p>Uber agrees to send in my name a “Pay me £7.23 for that shared ride” to my Facebook friends, but not to people for whom I can’t prove I know well enough. Tinder shows shared relations with strangers. That is a powerful web of features unlocked thanks to this. That’s why building an API was such a key early change of what Facebook was.<p>Typically, Twitter does something similar to Facebook on the surface (a news feed) but is not planning on serving as an authentication layer, so they do a lot less to address grievers, inauthentic accounts and lately, unwanted political influence.<p>The News Feed was the first key feature, built internally and it boosted the business model that Facebook has started leveraging: targeted advertising. But neither the News Feed, not advertising is the core of Facebook — no more than ads are at the core of Google.<p>Google wants to leverage artificial intelligence to organise the world’s information. That your friends matter to you and that you trust them more, and that you want computers to tell who they are is what’s at the core of Facebook; the recent pivot to communities is clearly in that line: you also trust and are willing to help people that you might not have met before because you belong to certain groups, communities.<p>Ads are a simple and effective way to finance both projects. Because management had to place ad-focused people high up, they took over a bit of the attention, but leaders at both companies know to focus on the end-goal.<p>I can easily imagine Facebook making more money from transaction fee, or distributing 3D-content; I can imagine Google making more money similarly (typically, CPA is kind of that). Both have tried, and the results were underwhelming, and will most likely try again.",Twitter
2017-09-15 15:01:37,A lingering farewell to the username,If they do (I haven&#x27;t verified if you&#x27;re right) then that&#x27;s an implementation issue. Twitters API returns rich information about every mention that shows they very well could store an association to the internal user id if they want to.<p>But it may very well be for good reason. E.g. lets say an account is taken over by someone who changes the account into something suitably offensive after obtaining a lot of mentions. It would seem that treating a change as basically &quot;this is a new account now&quot; is the safest alternative in some respects.,Twitter

That changed my view of PHP completely and it improved my code quality and potential by a 10x factor at least.
I think that what Taylor Otwell has done in the last years with Laravel and with its ecosystem has been really underestimated. Not just for Laravel that is an excellent framework in my opinion, but especially with all the other products and libraries that he built along the way.
It covers all the needs I had in building my last few SaaS products and it made my life soooo much easier.<p>A few examples:<p>Forge and Envoyer: setup and manage your VPS in a breeze and deploy your code with zero downtime.<p>Spark: create a SaaS product in literally a matter of minutes without having to care about all the boilerplates<p>Echo: real time notification across multiple channels (mail, Pusher, Slack, etc.)<p>Passport: OAuth2 API server as easy as it can be<p>Scout: Redis&#x2F;Algolia search with just a couple of lines of code<p>Dusk: test your app easily both for unit and browser testing<p>Cashier: payments with Stripe and Braintree in a breeze (both for one time payment and recurring ones)<p>Socialite: OAuth for all kind of services (Facebook, Twitter, Google, ...)<p>And beside all this, there is the excellent Laracasts by Jeffrey Way that made me learn not just Laravel but PHP and JS in general in a really great way.<p>And I could go on talking with the great and simple queueing system, the perfect integration with VueJS that I love as well, ...<p>As you can see I&#x27;m a big big fan of Laravel in general and I hope that it will become popular in HN especially over time.",Twitter

Not every bad experience for a gay man is because of homophobia.<p>I have worked as a programmer for 25 years and I can assure every woman out there that men often treat other men very badly. I have seen programmers go ape shit because someone changed their code. Deliberately criticize another&#x27;s work in front of a group in order to undermine them. Men play politics and undercut other men to boost their own reputation and career chances.<p>Some of the twitter comments identify sexist situations but some look to me like a man being a douche for reasons that might have nothing to do with sexism.

2017-06-10 18:03:55,"Netflix: Container Scheduling, Execution and Integration with AWS (2016) [video]","Note: I&#x27;m the one in the video, an original engineer on Titus, and now the product&#x2F;hiring manager of the Titus team at Netflix. Also, I do not actively monitor hacker news, so it is unlikely that I&#x27;ll follow-on to this conversation (@aspyker on Twitter is an easier way to reach me).<p>Is Titus Open Source Yet? No.<p>Why?<p>Reason #1: When we created Titus, we married the back end of a container execution engine (Titan) with the front end of a scheduling system for stream processing (Mantis). We have a goal at the time to stabilize existing usage at Netflix. We didn&#x27;t have a goal of removing all code from both sides that wasn&#x27;t needed after the marriage. We wanted to clean this up before releasing in open source as we would have to spend more time telling people what to ignore in the codebase that is no longer used in Titus. We also didn&#x27;t have time to create proper interfaces that separate Titus from other important operational systems at Netflix. We have recently been re-implementing the engine to have clean interfaces with minimal code.<p>Reason #2: When Titus was created it had a user API that grew during initial usage in batch applications. Given the number of clients using this API, it was hard to change it without impacting users. Compounding this, we added service application support without thinking much about making the API well designed. We have recently been working on a new API that was designed to handle both use cases. This API is currently being adjusted based on internal feedback.<p>Reason #3: The space of container management platforms is truly a crowded space. There are many other great options out there. When we eventually open source Titus, we hope it is clear why Titus is unique in this space specifically for &quot;all-in&quot; Amazon EC2 customers, for NetflixOSS cloud platform adopters (those who use Spinnaker, Eureka, etc.), and supporting the level of complexity we do (VPC IP per container, GPU&#x27;s, complex fleet and capacity management, etc.). Finally, showing how at scale production battle hardened Titus is. We realize even with these differences, we&#x27;ll spend a consider amount of time justifying these points to those who look at the space more generally. We would prefer to not spend any time &quot;marketing&quot; our differences.<p>Reason #4: Our main focus at Netflix is to service Netflix developers providing the easiest to use and most reliable service. Open source is something that is valuable to us with regards to potential external contributions as well hiring and retention of the best engineering talent in the world. This value, while significant, isn&#x27;t as important as providing our internal Netflix value. As a part time responsibility I help open source at Netflix. Therefore, I am also aware that doing open source well (like NetflixOSS Spinnaker as a shining example) requires more investment for teams than posting the code to github. Our team is small today and we do not believe we can make Titus open source as great as we&#x27;d want it to be. That said, we&#x27;re growing (did I mention I&#x27;m the hiring manager - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.netflix.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;862432"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.netflix.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;862432</a>) every day and can see the value of changing this equation.<p>I am truly honored that someone would great a whole website to ask for Titus. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.istitusopensourceyet.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.istitusopensourceyet.com&#x2F;</a> made me laugh last night and decide to write this response today.

2017-06-05 10:52:12,Ask HN: Why Use Social Media Logins?,"As a &quot;user&quot;, I love logging in with social media. How awesome is it that I can just click a button and be logged in instantly? No worrying about setting up a password, at least, for most websites. I used to not trust it, but after becoming a developer and learning: it is just grabbing an email or a name is not too bad. Though sometimes, it may grab more than that, such as your friends list, etc. Somehow, that became okay and no one cares.<p>As a &quot;developer&quot;, things are quite different. There are a few libraries of code on Github and you can find examples across the Internet. For the most part, these examples do work after you have set up some API backend on the social media platforms themselves.<p>Code would almost seem straightforward. However, it is not always the case, especially, when a social media platform is ever-changing.  For example, last week, someone released a new product on Hacker News and went about his way, only to realize, that people were attempting to login to Facebook, which recently upgraded from SDK 4 to SDK 5. Massive changes occurred. How embarrassing to go live, only for one of your social media buttons not to work? It&#x27;s not his fault, but it&#x27;s Facebook who updated their code so older versions no longer work. Most developers are trying to focus on their own code and make sure it works. Now they have to worry about potential users being unable to access the front door?<p>When I went to update Facebook SDK 4 to SDK 5 on one of my own platforms, using Facebook&#x27;s very example that they provided. I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I ended up removing Facebook from my registration and login screen. The three that remained were Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn.<p>After some careful testing with these three, they work for the most part, except occasionally, if someone logs into Google, and then tries to login again real fast, such as your code not remembering them and keeping them logged in, Google&#x27;s token expires and it won&#x27;t auto-generate a new one, and it creates a problem, an error that you can&#x27;t even catch, so your users are exposed to seeing that error.<p>Twitter, too, seems to have some issues. Using the examples you can easily find on the Internet, and I&#x27;m no genius when it comes to this stuff, but I managed to copy some code, put it together, and make it work with my database, this would also come with problems: It keeps looping and acquiring a new oauth token without ever going back to my website with the information.  After spending nearly an hour trying to figure out what the problem was and scouring the Internet with very few answers, I gave up. So Twitter has now been removed.<p>LinkedIn is my last resort, but to offer only one option: is it better at all?<p>The purpose of social media logins was to making logging in easier, but none of these social media platforms have beginner or even novice developers in mind. If any of the code was to change while your web application is live, than you are screwed, trying to come up with a patch for it. Lest, you might not even find out until someone actually reports it that your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google login isn&#x27;t working. How would you know otherwise, since you probably might only use one or none?<p>I sought to find out: Do we really need to use social media logins? In this day and age, it is supposedly expected. For the most part, researching claims, there is a 60% usage of social media login buttons. But are they necessary? I came across another article from a developer at MailChimp which makes a great point about social logins: while people use them, if people like your application or find it useful, they are going to register and login with a username or email address, regardless of whether you have social media or not.<p>Here is the article: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2F;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2F;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-...</a><p>Navigating to MailChimp&#x27;s registration and login page: there is no social media presence.<p>So I know there are some attempts at making life easier for developers out there, such as Hybridauth Social Login PHP Library ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hybridauth.github.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hybridauth.github.io&#x2F;</a> ), which may do a good job, but I&#x27;ve not used it yet.  There are also other non-free solutions out there in which you pay for a script or a web company to handle it all for you. This too, might be good, but why? Why isn&#x27;t it easier for developers to set up social media buttons?<p>Maybe it is security concerns or whatever, but you would think that as large as these social media platforms are, they&#x27;d be better at giving you the email and username or whatever you need.. and making it easier. After all, it is technically free branding for them that you put on your website.<p>Anyone else struggle with social media login or just give up completely or maybe you found a really easy solution that grants you peace of mind?",Twitter
2017-05-27 09:03:52,Security of BIOS/UEFI System Firmware from Attacker and Defender Perspectives,"Seeing slides in BIOS-UEFI-Security.6-Mitigations.pdf that imply that there&#x27;s critical crypto being done in SMM mode makes me feel unfathomable hopelessness. The whole x86_64 platform security model (which includes all the privilege levels and the corresponding access control mechanisms) is one hell of an overgrown clusterfuck that could not be <i>more</i> hostile to formal verification.<p>There&#x27;s lots of wantonly convoluted stuff going on -- a random example is the access control mechanism for the PCH&#x27;s GPIOs (search &quot;GPIO registers lockdown&quot;, in quotes). This isn&#x27;t, of course, implemented with a register which contains bitfields determining which privilege level can write to which sets of registers. That would be too simple. The GPIO Lockdown-Enable bit <i>can</i> [sic] be changed by the same software that the lockdown mechanism is meant to deny access to! This seems like utter pointlessness -- what use is an access control mechanism if the agent being restricted can change the parameters of the mechanism willy-nilly -- but Intel has a solution! Changing the lockdown-enable bit triggers an SMI and shunts control to SMM mode, which is, naturally, expected to include code that figures out that this bit should not be disabled, and is to flip it back on (and return from the interrupt, having trashed the caches a bit).<p>This is, of course, a pathologically needless level of complexity -- in the ARM world, we have registers with silly names like &quot;NSACR&quot; that higher-privileged execution modes can set to restrict access to certain resources. There&#x27;s certainly no BIOS-OEM-provided code that needs to exist and be correct in order to implement such a basic task. In the end, this level of access-control is equivalent to a bloody Boolean operation or two, for heaven&#x27;s sake! All the CPU needs to do is to decode the instruction, realise it&#x27;s a potentially-privileged instruction, decode what the instruction tries to modify, look up in a table which register holds the relevant permissions bitfield, and do the relevant boolean operation between that register&#x27;s contents and an appropriate bitmask, and fault depending on the result. Since there&#x27;s an extremely close match between the properties that needs to hold (the truth table of all combinations of &quot;privilege level <i>x</i> can modify resource <i>y</i> iff bit <i>n</i> in register <i>z</i> is set&quot;) and the mechanism that enforces it, it&#x27;s easy to reason about this scheme and not difficult to either prove an implementation correct (or find counterexamples).<p>Meanwhile, the &quot;wake up SMM and hope it&#x27;ll countermands the illegal write&quot; scheme depends on a lot more machinery. How does it work on a multi-core&#x2F;multi-socket platform? How does this mechanism interact with the caches or the memory model? Is it possible to set up a race condition where the illegal write ends up going through uncountermanded because SMM mode can be made to not see the register in an illegal state? This is orders of magnitude of orders of magnitude more complex than analysing a lookup-table and a bitmask -- we need to understand the semantics of memory reads&#x2F;writes, of caching, of mode switches to SMM and the SMI interrupt, and how all of this clusterfuck is affected by the fact that there&#x27;s <i>multiple cores</i> in our system. LANGSEC people will call this a &quot;shotgun parser&quot; -- when input data checking &#x2F; recognition is interspersed with processing logic.<p>Even if all of this miraculously works and there&#x27;s literally no way that all the cores working together can send an illegal write that SMM code won&#x27;t countermand -- there&#x27;s still the issue of making sure that the specific SMM blob that our BIOS OEM wrote cooperates properly with this. Indeed, making BIOS OEMs implement these sorts of convoluted and critical mechanisms and expecting them to get all of them perfectly right requires a level of optimism that doesn&#x27;t yet exist. The situation has devolved to the point that there is literally a tool called &quot;chipsec&quot; that lets you test for the presence of a handful of well-known security-critical things (from time to time someone discovers a new one, of course, UEFI&#x2F;ACPI and the x86_64 privilege model is too complex for people to be sure that we found all the issues) that UEFI programmers are <i>notorious</i> for messing up. That this tool needs to exist is shameful. Of course, the security of the x86_64 platform doesn&#x27;t just depend on a bunch of magic access control registers being set right, there&#x27;s Turing-complete code that needs to be implemented by the BIOS OEM (and runs in the most privileged execution mode that isn&#x27;t Intel&#x27;s &quot;management processor&quot;) that is <i>security-critical</i>, and, well, it&#x27;s hard to prove that arbitrary Turing-complete code behaves correctly.<p>The auxiliary CPU mode (SMM) initially meant to hide APM and emulate PS&#x2F;2 mice in 90s-era computers is now <i>critical</i> to platform security, and does dangerous stuff like crypto and handling pointers from UEFI &#x2F; the OS. Every few months someone I follow on Twitter finds some new way to trick some widely-deployed SMM code into writing to a memory region it shouldn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s quite depressing. Great. Another pointless defender&#x2F;attacker arms race that the defenders could decisively win had Intel thrown away the spitefully complex intricacies of SMM and the x86 security model and replaced it with a clean, formal-verification-friendly set of privilege levels whose correct operation doesn&#x27;t depend on platform firmware code. Even AArch64 is less broken when it comes to this.",Twitter

2017-04-06 17:36:30,New APIs to power customer engagement in Direct Messages,"Twitter also did something that I find particularly interesting: they somehow convinced developers that you needed them to bless your app and provide APIs to build a client that accesses their service, even though those credentials must be distributed <i>to the public with your client</i>. To people like me who are old enough to have dealt with AOL, the idea that developers are willing to buy into this fiction is absolutely insane: if the official Twitter client can do it, then so can your client, and there is nothing Twitter can do to stop you that doesn&#x27;t also break their client (which they are generally <i>less</i> willing to do than change their API on short notice!).<p>As far as I can tell the only thing that enforces this is what should amount to an antitrust level of collusion between the mega-companies to restrict access to products (via services such as the Apple App Store) that do things that the other mega-companies dislike, as it is in all of their best interests to maintain this same fiction. The reality is that client-side API keys are totally meaningless and make no sense: in an attempt to believe they make sense some developers then start to believe other crazy things like &quot;if I compile a token into my program other people can&#x27;t read it as it is compiled&quot; or to insist &quot;there must be some way to encrypt my binary to make sure that other people can&#x27;t get my API key&quot;, but this kind of broken thought only happens due to a broken premise :&#x2F;.<p>(That said, it isn&#x27;t 100% clear to me that if someone released a true Twitter client Apple would remove it, so if someone disagrees with that premise I am all ears: that is simply the only theoretical mechanism I can see that would seem to enforce this, and I feel like I have heard of this happening before, but AFAIK the random apps in the App Store for abusing Tindr are all based on reverse engineering the true API for the service, but it is also possible that Apple cares less about helping Tindr or that Tindr has a different internal mentality and culture surrounding this kind of thing; or it could even be the case that these now have been removed and I haven&#x27;t noticed yet as I don&#x27;t really pay much attention to track them, or even that I am wrong and they are somehow more indirect in their implementation.)",Twitter

My primary crime was being <i>careless</i>, and I am sure paying one hell of a price for it.  Living in this shelter trying to find work with no clothes, even after I supposedly paid my debt to society, sure feels like I’m nowhere near done with the punishment.<p>What is deeply maddening, however, is the fact that the police violated my liberties and right to be protected from unreasonable search and seizure.  It was an open and shut case according to my public defender and the whole thing was recorded on his body cam, but I quickly realized that <i>I would have spend significantly more time in jail waiting for a trial to beat it then I would by taking a &quot;deal&quot; where the case was dropped to a misdemeanor.</i><p>At the core of it, my inability to create loving relationships at this point in my life, the kind that could have helped me bail out in time to not to lose my job, handicaps me in a big way, and surely is a driver of my substance use as well.

Obviously not a graceful change but I feel there should not be that as many people working there as there are now.<p>2. Focus on engagement, not growth. Twitter may not be growing in the way that the market wants, but the users that it does have are incredibly devoted to the platform. If I were to leave Twitter there&#x27;s nowhere else I could go. If I leave Tinder or Snapchat there are many other platforms that can fill almost the same niche. Twitter needs to capitalize on that.<p>3. Make brands pay to have a page. In other words, if you&#x27;re not an individual, you must pay to create an account. Savvy companies have realized that being on Twitter is a key part of a solid social media campaign. To not be on Twitter is to miss out on a huge opportunity to reach a very devoted audience, and you can&#x27;t reach that audience anywhere else (#2). Some brands are already doing this well (e.g. Wendy&#x27;s.) If the choice comes to paying for the opportunity to market on Twitter, and not market at all, companies will gladly pay. On the plus side, this could let Twitter reduce the interstitial ads on the timeline.<p>Everyone hates ads, but the way that brands have engaged with individuals on Twitter really humanizes them and makes people form more real relationships with them. It also forces brands to be more accountable and aware.<p>4. Bring back Vine. A huge part of Twitter&#x27;s staying power is the unique culture it has created (#2). Staying power is what gives Twitter its greatest value to advertisers (#3).<p>5. Ramp up engagement on Periscope. Periscope being a part of Twitter makes a lot of sense because Twitter is all about stuff happening live. It&#x27;s a great platform but I think it also needs a desktop client (with OBS support, the way Twitch does) to allow the caliber of content creation to go up.<p>6. Re-open APIs. Twitter has sown a bad seed with the dev community by making its API very restricted. Tweets make up a very interesting dataset on which other people could build very unique things on top of. Twitter should encourage this, not stifle it. &quot;Look what cool things we can do with Twitter&quot; will only serve to strengthen the image of Twitter as a unique, irreplaceable platform.<p>---<p>These are the main issues I see as an everyday user of Twitter.

2017-02-27 20:09:27,Prophet: forecasting at scale,"&gt; Anecdotally, there is a ton of money left on the table by established businesses...<p>True. 
fwiw, I worked on the same project at Twitter 4 years back - the Facebook folks call it capacity planning at scale, we called it capacity utilization modeling. The goal was the same - there are all these &quot;jobs&quot; - 10s of 1000s of programs running on distributed clusters, hogging CPU, memory and disk. Can we look at a snapshot in time of the jobs usage, and then predict&#x2F;forecast what the next quarter jobs usage would be ?
If you get these forecasts right ( within reasonable error bounds ), the folks making purchasing decisions ( how many machines to lease for the next quarter for the datacenters) can save a bundle.<p>From an engineering pov, every job would need to log it&#x27;s p95 and p99 CPU usage, memory stats, disk stats...Since Twitter was running some 50k programs back then (2013ish) on these Mesos clusters, the underlying C++ API had hooks to obtain CPU and memory stats, even though the actual programs running were all coded up in Scala (mostly), or python&#x2F;Ruby (bigger minority), or C&#x2F;Java&#x2F;R&#x2F;perl ( smaller minority ). There&#x27;s an interesting Quora discussion on why Mesos was in C++ while rest of Twitter is Scalaland...mostly because you can&#x27;t do these sort of CPU&#x2F;memory&#x2F;disk profiling in the jvmland as well as you can in C++.<p>OK, so you now have all these CPU stats. What do you do with them ? Before you get to that, you have the usual engineering hassles - how often should you obtain the CPU stats ? Where would you store them ?<p>So at Twitter we got these stats every minute ( serious overkill :) and stored them in a monstrous JSON ( horrible idea given 50000 programs * number of minutes in day * all the different stats you were storing :))<p>So every day I&#x27;d get a gigantic 20gb JSON from infra, then I&#x27;d have to do the modeling.<p>In those days, you couldn&#x27;t find a single Scala JSON parser that would load up that gigantic JSON without choking. We tried them all. Finally we settled on GSON - Google&#x27;s JSON parser written in Java, that handled these gigantic jsons with no hiccups.<p>Before you get to the math, you would have to parse the JSON and build a data structure that would store these (x,t) tuples in memory. You had 50k programs, so each program would get a model, each model originated from a shitton of (x,t) tuples, the t being minutely and the fact that some of these programs had been running for years, meant you had very large datasets.<p>The math was relatively straightforward...I used so called &quot;LAD&quot; - least absolute deviation from mean, as opposed to simple OLS, because least squares wasn&#x27;t quite predictive for that use case. Building the LAD modeling thing in Scala was somewhat interesting...Most of the work was done by the commons math Apache libraries, I mostly had to ensure the edge cases wouldn&#x27;t throw you off, because LAD admits multiple solutions to the same dataset - it&#x27;s not like OLS where you give it a dataset and it finds a unique best fit line. Here you&#x27;d have many lines sitting in an array, depending on how long you let the Simplex solver run. 
Then came the problem of visualizing these 50,000 piecewise line models using javascript heh heh. The front end guys had a ball with the models I spit out.<p>If someone&#x27;s doing this from scratch these days, NNs would be your best bet. Regime changes are a big part of that.",Twitter

2017-02-22 15:59:49,"Google Site Search will be completely shut down by April 1, 2018","Last couple of years or so have been an eye opener for me on how I choose libraries, tools and services for my project. One important lesson was that never choose a service which don&#x27;t have plug and play open source alternative. Even hyped start ups go out of business and big companies like Facebook and Google shut down services.<p>Third party APIs are a even bigger risk. Facebook and Twitter APIs used to change quite often 2-3 years ago. (Haven&#x27;t personally worked on this off late though.) APIs and services which seem too cheap are generally the ones which should be avoided. Because it is more likely that the companies running these will not find a sustainable business model.<p>Even Open Source projects get abandoned quite often. Sometimes a team puts together an impressive open source project and then they get acquired by a big company which results in abandonment of the project. I have one client who has his startup riding on Kurento Media Server for WebRTC calls. This product is in development from last one and half years. Now, after Kurento&#x27;s acquisition by Twilio, Kurento&#x27;s future is not clear. Also it&#x27;s not a project which any body can just get into and start developing it further. Thankfully Kurento is not abandoned yet by the development team, but I had read somewhere that they are looking for new maintainers.<p>The lesson learned is only depend on mature open source projects and depend on PaaS services which make those open source projects available as easy to use services. Even if that PaaS service go down, there is a high chance that you will find someone who can deploy and support it for you.<p>However, if you are depending on a third party API or a relatively unknown Open Source Project for critical functionality, treat it as a big risk in your product&#x27;s future road map and be prepared with a contingency plan.<p>Right now in cloud services there are way too many products which are not easily replaceable.

So they still end up in the stack, especially when the clients themselves push for these services to be used.",Twitter
2017-01-27 16:33:58,Introducing React Navigation for React Native,"react-navigation has very different goals, and it&#x27;s still in beta, things like transitions are likely to change significantly before 1.0 release.<p>The main difference in the goals is that react-navigation is intended to be entirely cross-platform, including iOS, Android, ReactVR, and web. It&#x27;s implemented entirely in JavaScript which has a huge upside because you can ship updates to it OTA and you can submit patches without needing to know ObjC&#x2F;Java and the platform&#x27;s respective navigation APIs. It will be an important library to push forward development of more powerful general purpose native APIs, for example the native driver for Animated was built with the intention of making it possible to run navigation transitions on the UI thread.

Learned (through multiple failings) how to think about markets, interview customers, how to motivate and lead, build realistic roadmaps, raise money, do sales.<p>After 5 years, sold my company as a 1st base hit exit. I had no problem getting mid-career PM interviews, despite having never been &#x27;officially&#x27;a PM. Focused on big scale consumer because I wanted maximize my leverage&#x2F;impact.<p>Junior positions? See todd_sherman&#x27;s response (Hi Todd!).<p>Skills – well covered elsewhere. The short version is &quot;Get the right things built &amp; shipped.&quot; To do that, you need to know (1) what the right things are (user problems, strategy, markets, corporate politics, etc) and (2) get them built &amp; shipped (working with eng &amp; design, leadership, resourcing, more politics). It&#x27;s harder than it sounds, there are many many more wrong things than right things (and many wrong things can sound pretty right).<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m biased, but I think founding a company is an ideal pre-PM curriculum. When big tech co&#x27;s acquire companies, the CEOs almost always become PMs, for good reason. This knowledge changes the risk equation as a founder, being a PM at a great company is a pretty awesome backup plan.",Twitter
2017-01-20 14:56:16,The Infrastructure Behind Twitter: Scale,"Twitters analytics are either lossy or eventually consistent [1]. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re resource intensive, but they&#x27;re taking shortcuts that makes them very amenable to saving resources (unless it&#x27;s just very buggy).<p>In terms of the broadcast problem, it&#x27;s trivially handled by splitting large follower lists into trees, and introducing message reflectors.  Twitters message counts is high for a public IM system, but it&#x27;s not that high overall messaging volume for private&#x2F;internal message flows. More importantly, despite the issue of large follower counts, if breaking large accounts into trees of reflectors, it decomposes neatly, and federating large message flows like this is a well understood problem:<p>I&#x27;ve half-jokingly in the past you could replace a lot of Twitters core transmission of tweets with mail servers and off the shelf mailing-list reflectors, and some code to create mailboxes for accounts an reflectors to break up large follower lists (no, it wouldn&#x27;t be efficient, but the point is distributing message transfers including reflecting messages to large lists is a well understood problem), and based on the mail volumes I&#x27;ve handled with off the shelf servers I&#x27;ll confidently say that 100&#x27;s of millions of messages a day that way is not all that hard to handle with relatively modest server counts.<p>Fast delivery of tweets using reflectors to extreme accounts would be the one thing that could drive the server number up high, but on the other hand, there are also plenty of far more efficient ways of handling it (e.g. extensive caching + pulling rather than pushing for the most extreme accounts)<p>Note, I&#x27;m not saying Twitter doesn&#x27;t have a legitimate need or the servers they use - their web app does a lot of expensive history&#x2F;timeline generation on top of the core message exchange for example. And the number of servers does not say much about their chosen tradeoffs in terms of server size&#x2F;cost vs. number of servers, but the core message exchange should not be where the complexity is unless they&#x27;re doing something very weird.<p>[1] Taking snapshots of their analytics and the API follower&#x2F;following count shows they don&#x27;t agree, and the analytics numbers changes after the fact on a regular basis.",Twitter

2016-10-26 16:51:53,Announcing .NET Core 1.1 Preview 1,"Depends on what APIs you need, and what your tolerance is for futzing around with things.  If you need the larger API surface of the .NET Framework and you don&#x27;t have time to be on the bleeding edge, go with Mono.  Xamarin Studio has good support for it, and even if you&#x27;re using some other editor (VSCode, Spacemacs, etc.) everything still generally works with the tooling for Mono.<p>There are basically two components that need polishing for .NET Core to be a reasonable choice - the implementation of NetStandard 2.0 for .NET Core (so you get all the old APIs back), and for the tooling to mature (transition from project.json back to fsproj).  These efforts are coming along nicely [1][2], but still aren&#x27;t ready for prime time.<p>Here&#x27;s a roadmap that Enrico Sada has laid out to get the F# .NET Core situation to maturity: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;enricosada&#x2F;6f0a0424ca65b9d08e5a84f79560c4c6"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;enricosada&#x2F;6f0a0424ca65b9d08e5a84f79...</a><p>And by the way, don&#x27;t worry too much about switching over from Mono to .NET Core.  With NetStandard 2.0 the API changes should be minimal.

It&#x27;s exactly the same as your Twitter and Facebook developer examples.<p>Developers were monetizing the Twitter platform until Twitter pulled the rug out.  Facebook has similarly neutered their API to the point where it is nearly useless, and many businesses were crushed in the wake of the changes.  You seem to be saying that it&#x27;s only unhealthy when developers are affected, but that isn&#x27;t the case.  Developers have no &quot;inherent right to succeed on the good graces of another business allowing them to&quot; either,  yet you see that as unhealthy.<p>Publishers and developers are just users of the system, getting crushed when Facebook doesn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s getting a big enough cut.  I would also argue that Facebook actively blocking the sharing of external content that its users choose to share with each other simply because they aren&#x27;t getting their cut is different than the affected businesses believing they have an &quot;inherent right to succeed on the good graces of another business&quot;.

Sadly we don&#x27;t have the option to rent a cloud service for our company.<p>To sum it up, I think it&#x27;s great that docker is becoming a competitor to kubernetes their attitude towards quality always impressed me and thus far I&#x27;m sold on it, but the best outcome of this is that having docker in the cluster managers competition may help raise the bar for every system.",Twitter

2016-07-09 06:04:43,Pinboard Turns Seven,"I switched to Pinboard few months ago when Delicious committed seppuku and made their site completely unusable. First, Delicious just shut down their site for something like a week, then they resurrected some ancient version of their site that looks &amp; behaves like it&#x27;s from 2007. Then they switched to an old domain (del.icio.us) and broke every bookmarklet and plugin that used their API. (I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re planning on selling delicious.com domain name, which is worth a lot of money, so they made the switch.)<p>But the worst part is that you can&#x27;t even save a link with all these changes they’ve made!

2016-06-21 20:22:55,Image Hosting on Reddit,"Yes.

Twitter did the same thing much more loudly when they realized that they were giving away the farm by letting most of their userbase access the content via third-party apps.<p>This works because imgur and other image hosts are already well-integrated into third-party reddit apps, but reddit&#x27;s image hosting isn&#x27;t yet, and they can change things around&#x2F;break it repeatedly until users get annoyed and just move to the official app to try to get a more seamless experience.",Twitter

2016-06-04 02:45:46,Ask HN: How can I better market my JavaScript library,"Hey.  I think I&#x27;m in a pretty good position to give you some feedback.  As background, I maintain a well-received list of high-quality React and Redux tutorials and articles [0], and a catalog of Redux-related libraries, addons, and utilities [1].  I also spend a lot of time hanging out in the Reactiflux chat channels, and apparently currently have the messages posted in Reactiflux since the service moved to Discord [2].  Finally, I wrote the official Redux FAQ page from scratch [3].  So, while I&#x27;m not a public name in the React community like Dan Abramov, I&#x27;m pretty in tune with what&#x27;s going on in the ecosystem.<p>The first thing to consider is that the size of the target market for any &quot;addon&quot;, &quot;mod&quot;, or &quot;extension&quot; for any technology is, by definition, limited to the size of the user base for the original technology.  While Redux is certainly popular, and basically the winner of the &quot;Flux Wars&quot;, you&#x27;re limited to a subset of the JS dev community.<p>A second factor is idiomatic usage.  Any framework ecosystem is going to have an idiomatic way of doing things.  Tutorials will teach those same idioms, training classes will teach those idioms, people will write apps using those idioms, and the vast majority of the userbase is going to share those idioms.  When you start going outside those idioms, fewer people will understand your approach, and fewer people will be interested in something that&#x27;s not &quot;the normal way&quot;.<p>Redux is fairly minimal, so similar to Backbone, there _is_ a fairly active ecosystem with people adding numerous different spins in usage, and additional layers on top, like yours.  However, only a few of those have gained particular traction (like redux-saga).  Idiomatic Redux tends towards explicit and functional, rather than implicit and object-oriented.<p>Third, there are a number of overlapping approaches and implementations being developed by different people, as you can see by browsing my addons catalog.  Two dozen libraries implementing &quot;local&#x2F;component state&quot; in various ways, a dozen more for &quot;subscribe to changes in a slice of state&quot;, and I don&#x27;t know HOW many approaches to handling &quot;side effects&quot;.  Not sure how much of that is people not knowing what else is out there, how much is &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; syndrome, and how much is people just trying to scratch an itch.  So, any one addon in a given category is somewhat competing for mindshare, and only a few will really get attention.<p>Fourth, honestly, a lot of it really is actually getting the attention of the &quot;thought leaders and influencers&quot;.  I signed up for Twitter just so I could actually reply to some of the conversations I saw going on, and when Dan saw that, he tweeted out that I&#x27;d just joined.  Five minutes later I had 30 followers, and 100 by the end of the day.  Small potates as Twitter goes, obviously, but the point is that people followed me just because Dan said I was interesting.  (I&#x27;m not, really :) )  The &quot;Doing Whatever Dan Abramov Tells Me To Do&quot; fake book cover has a bit of truth to it [4].  Now, I&#x27;m not saying go harass Dan, or Ryan Florence, or Christopher Chedeau, but when core members of the React&#x2F;Redux community point at stuff, other people look.  And, that said, Dan does tweet out anything that looks vaguely interesting, so tweeting him a link is a valid approach.<p>So, Radical.  I _do_ actually have Radical listed in my addons catalog, but I have it listed on the &quot;Variations&quot; page [5], which is where I list libraries that are distinctly deviating from the idiomatic Redux approach (and, as you&#x27;ll note, there&#x27;s quite a few of those).  Looking at it, there&#x27;s good points and bad points.<p>Good:<p>- &quot;Reducing boilerplate&quot; is certainly a viable selling point.  One of Redux&#x27;s core principles is that things are explicit rather than implicit, but obviously many people dislike much of the verbosity.  So, that&#x27;s a good focus.<p>- Radical has documentation.  Like, _real_ documentation.  An actual description that tries to give a motivation and explanation, some meaningful code samples, and API docs.  The average JS lib on Github has a short repo one-liner, maybe a couple paragraphs in the README, and a five-line code snippet with very little explanation for where it fits in.  This is decidedly a good thing.<p>Mixed:<p>- Focus on grouping actions and reducers.  Again, there&#x27;s numerous opinions and ideas, and putting those together _is_ one semi-popular approach (per the &quot;Ducks&quot; concept), so it&#x27;s not unheard of.  On the other hand, Dan encourages arbitrary reducers responding to arbitrary actions to prevent coupling, and that&#x27;s considered the idiomatic approach.<p>- Use of Typescript in the lib and the samples.  There are certainly Typescript users in the Redux community, but ES6 is the common approach.<p>Bad:<p>- Use of an OOP approach to managing things.  I know it&#x27;s still dispatching actions and such and updating its own slice of the store, but the Redux community is heavily influenced by Functional Programming, and as such an OOP approach is less likely to gain interest.<p>- The fact that you do need to hook the generated reducer into the store isn&#x27;t as clearly called out as I&#x27;d like to see.<p>- Lack of a full-blown example written using Radical.  Again, the fact that you have actual code samples is good, but if this is such a big improvement, a &quot;real&quot; app example would go a long way to show that.<p>- Both the docs and the source are in single files.  Both might be easier to read through if they were split into smaller pieces.<p>- There&#x27;s a number of libraries that look like they do something fairly similar.  The list at [6] has many that are more component-oriented, but there&#x27;s some overlap.  The list at [5] also has some similar options.<p>Overall, it looks like a well-written library, with a valid use case, but the fact that it&#x27;s a non-idiomatic approach means there won&#x27;t be as much interest, and therefore fewer users _and_ fewer people willing to pass it along.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I hang out in the Reactiflux chat channels [7] evenings EST if you&#x27;d like to drop in and talk about it.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;react-redux-links"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;react-redux-links</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;redux-ecosystem-links"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;redux-ecosystem-links</a><p>[2] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipend.github.io&#x2F;reactiflux-dashboard&#x2F;#&#x2F;fame?ago=1+year"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipend.github.io&#x2F;reactiflux-dashboard&#x2F;#&#x2F;fame?ago=1+ye...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;FAQ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;FAQ.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ThePracticalDev&#x2F;status&#x2F;718462272335704064"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ThePracticalDev&#x2F;status&#x2F;71846227233570406...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;redux-ecosystem-links&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;variations.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;redux-ecosystem-links&#x2F;blob&#x2F;ma...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;redux-ecosystem-links&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;component-state.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;redux-ecosystem-links&#x2F;blob&#x2F;ma...</a><p>[7] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reactiflux.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reactiflux.com</a>",Twitter
2016-06-02 15:44:01,Twitter Is Betting Everything on Jack Dorsey. Will It Work?,"We&#x27;re saying the same thing here, in premise.  There is some value to be gained from a development ecosystem, undeniably.<p>The difference between what I&#x27;m saying is that the sheer magnitude of <i>unmonetized</i> Twitter Web users makes whatever small fish monetization increasing Twitter use with their integration look like chump change.<p>Now, there are several big players such as Periscope, Vine, Meerkat, that could have benefitted Twitter greatly from offering a development ecosystem.   But there are two reasons why they wouldn&#x27;t:<p>1) Twitter, like Facebook, is big enough - or, more accurately, <i>are expected to be big enough</i> - to be in the &quot;acquirer&quot; phase where they derive more value <i>competing against</i> and acquiring than <i>playing with</i> these popular new services.   
However, we&#x27;ve seen much of the industry being overvalued and some of us believe a small company can do more, faster, on a technical level than a big company due to bureaucracy, so expectations aren&#x27;t always matching up to reality.<p>Vine and Periscope were eventually acquired by Twitter.  And Meerkat was forced to pivot.<p>2) There are cost-benefit analyses that neither you, nor I, are privy to which found developing and maintaining an API by relatively highly-paid employees not worth the benefits seen by its integration by other companies.<p>&gt; Many startups or businesses in general look elsewhere for the information that is available on Twitter.<p>Are you sure of this?

2016-05-30 13:27:07,Ask HN: Advice needed regarding TDD from programmers,"I really enjoy TDD when I get into the rhythm, but I&#x27;ve found that setting up the infrastructure can be a real barrier, especially for a language&#x2F;framework that I&#x27;ve never worked in.<p>However, I have written code without it and I frequently find that when I do so, I very quickly regret it. Either I get confused about what precisely I&#x27;m doing or I end up having to write tests after-the-fact and it is much harder. The barrier is worth overcoming. How?<p>1) Find good tutorials and <i>work</i> through them.<p>A lot of people say that the best way to learn something is just to dive in and build something. I disagree, at least when that thing is new to you. I find it is much better to find a tutorial that guides you through building something the first time. It is worth asking around on twitter or on a relevant subreddit for this. Then, don&#x27;t just read--actually work through at least a good chunk of it. Once you&#x27;ve done that you have some code you can look back on when you are looking for the basics of how to set up your tests.<p>2) Don&#x27;t worry about mocking as much in the beginning.<p>The purpose of mocking is to avoid having the test take a long time to run due to the machine spending a bunch of time working on other things. Given that you are waiting on the machine when you run your test, this is actually meaningful. So, mocking intelligently can be a win if you it saves you that time. However, it also has the downsides that it can take a lot longer to write the test and it can make your test more brittle. For that reason I find it often makes sense not to mock and just write a bunch of tests that do in fact (for example) hit the database. This is especially a good idea with a new language where trying to use 7 new libraries at once (<i>cough</i> javascript <i>cough cough</i>) is going to lead to confusion.<p>Also note that TDD doesn&#x27;t really work if the code is already written because doing fine-grained tests for code that is already written is really hard. It is better to do interface&#x2F;API tests and put off unit testing until you are willing to refactor the code.<p>Note also that there are some tasks where your tests are going to be more like infrastructure tests and your changes won&#x27;t be quite as granular as TDD doctrine dictates. That is something you have to accept when everything is coming together, because that is the realm of integration tests.<p>There is a tutorial I&#x27;ve written which aims to teach this alongside teaching configuration management, though it is my first tutorial.

If by some miracle they agreed, it would give users a number of advantages including:<p>- Making customization (Greasemonkey etc.) easier by removing the need for customization tools to muddle through JS minification&#x2F;obfuscation.  While in practice various tools today are doing a good job customizing Gmail anyway, I imagine they could make more changes and more invasive changes with access to the source.<p>- Special case: making client-side encryption browser extensions safe.  Right now they are fundamentally unsafe (if they hook into the webapp rather than providing a separate interface), because there is nothing stopping Google from quietly adding some JS code to grab and report the plaintext before it gets encrypted.  <i>By itself</i>, releasing the webapp&#x27;s source wouldn&#x27;t fix this because you would still have to trust Google&#x27;s servers to send the same JS to everyone - but a browser extension could be enhanced to hash the page JS and refuse to operate with non-approved hashes, combined with a process where someone outside of Google manually approves changes as they are released, providing at least cursory review.  Nobody wants to review obfuscated code.<p>- Allowing users to detect and remove any other forms of tracking&#x2F;deanonymization that might be present such as mouse cursor or keystroke recording, canvas fingerprinting, etc., more reliably than with the sorts of purely technical measures that could be implemented in a browser (since these things are hard to block without preventing the app from doing its job).<p>- The kicker: Allowing the same webapp to be used with a different backend, so if you don&#x27;t want Google to have access to your email, or don&#x27;t trust them not to cripple functionality in the future, or need a lot of storage and can get it cheaper elsewhere, or are in China and have an (intentionally) shitty censored connection to the international internet, ... the list goes on... then you can self-host it, without losing the familiar interface.  You can also host your own clone service for others to use, perhaps forking off the original code when Google makes an unpopular change, as they are wont to do.  Of course this requires someone to actually do the technical work of writing a suitable new backend for the client to talk to, and in the case of a fork to maintain a huge codebase (compare Palemoon and such), but without free software you can&#x27;t even get started (legally).<p>Of course, Google might not be too happy about that last point.  But rms&#x27;s ideology has never been pragmatic about &#x27;business needs&#x27; and such.  It&#x27;s concerned only for the users.<p>Twitter is a somewhat less traditional case: the case for free software is either less applicable or far more, depending on how strictly you define &quot;free software&quot;.  This is because unlike Gmail, which provides decent support for third party clients, Twitter has long cracked down on them in various arbitrary ways and enforced strict rules that prevent them from innovating on UI.  Since one of the informally-defined &#x27;freedoms&#x27; of free software is the ability to modify it, it should be possible to morph the official browser client into anything you want - even if that means keeping just the API access layer and building an entirely new UI on top - and continue to use it freely.  Thus if Twitter changed their tune and actually dedicated themselves to these freedoms, that would imply starting to tolerate access by arbitrary client software, and users would hugely benefit.  However, if for some reason Twitter were to hypothetically release their client under a free license - even under the GPL - while otherwise continuing with their current policies, it wouldn&#x27;t affect the situation much.  The license would at least allow third parties to check the source for Twitter&#x27;s own API key and copy it into their own apps without exposing themselves to legal liability related to copyright&#x2F;DMCA.  But Twitter could still try to identify and block rogue clients, sue under the CFAA (&#x27;hacking&#x27; statute) for unauthorized access, ban the personal accounts of creators of rogue clients, etc.",Twitter

But I&#x27;m guessing that you would not go along with Twitter requesting all intellectual property rights to your integration code for the right to use their API. Why would you request it of the services that integrate with you?<p>But the biggest problem here is that you changed the game. You created and maintained the Pinboard integration.

2016-03-17 07:36:51,Twitter shut down Emojitracker's access,"I was responding to &quot;Big companies should not have the ability to destroy small businesses just because they changed their mind about something.&quot; as a general statement, since it was phrased in a general way.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s understood that a company could stop offering some data that a company is dependent on altogether, but I think it&#x27;s substantially less likely than a company threatening to terminate access to data that already exists (which is what happened here).<p>I&#x27;m not sure sure.  There&#x27;s regular griping on HN about Google cancelling services, even though they are generally beta services, because people expect them to offered.  Some of these people griping are people that built products on Google APIs that were discontinued.<p>&gt; Of course it&#x27;s ideal to have a contract with a company that guarantees access to the data stream for a reasonable chunk of time, but the reality is that unless you&#x27;re already a big shot, platform vendors like Twitter aren&#x27;t going to give you the time of day for something like that.<p>A contract?  Maybe not.  But if they have a clearly defined deprecation policy, that&#x27;s a start.  And if you are paying them, well that&#x27;s a lot better, since they are incentivized to keep it going because of your (and hopefully others&#x27;) money.<p>As for the rest (access to public API), I&#x27;m not really interested in arguing it, as we likely agree more than we disagree.  :)  The only caveat is that direct consumers of the API often don&#x27;t behave like regular public users, and that may put a strain on the system and degrade performance for everyone, causing real problems and the need to spend real money to fix if you still want to allow unfettered public use.",Twitter
2016-03-17 02:53:20,Twitter shut down Emojitracker's access,"&gt;Getting free access when it costs the other side (in managing access, serving requests, handling support, etc, no matter how small) is not something I would feel comfortable basing a business off of.<p>The difference is that the person is not getting anything that&#x27;s not already offered to the general public. It&#x27;s unfair to use the court system to enforce a company&#x27;s exclusionary political decision that &quot;everyone can access our website EXCEPT YOU&quot;, at least barring any actual contractual terms (not generic Terms of Use). The change I propose would not force anyone to accommodate a certain API change or provide any special functionality. It would simply prevent non-neutral access rules from being enforced via legal vectors.<p>Twitter would still be able to charge for access to the APIs they charge for now. They&#x27;d simply be unable to use the court system to compel someone to stop accessing the data that they have no copyright interest in and which they serve up to the world for free. I&#x27;m not sure if Twitter <i>has</i> tried to do this yet, but it&#x27;s the normal step companies take once a consumer develops the ability to evade their IP blocks.<p>To be honest, the law already <i>can</i> be interpreted this way. The problem is that it often isn&#x27;t. Companies have been able to convince non-technical judges that concepts like trespass to chattels are applicable any time someone is talking to their server. We need language in the law that will clarify the matter to prevent big companies from squashing small innovators that they find inconvenient or threatening instead of leaving it up to judge roulette.",Twitter

I know that&#x27;s a Catch-22, or a paradox, or whatever you want to call it, but that&#x27;s the sad reality for those of us that would like to leave the platform. So, in lieu of leaving, here are the features I feel like would help Twitter retain me as a user:<p>1. Bring back custom apps! Twitter is a <i>service</i>, and I want control over how I access that service. This would also take such a huge burden off of Twitter: don&#x27;t care about the super bowl? Use an app that lets you filter hashtags, piece of cake! So many features can be implemented on top of a service, with no extra effort from Twitter. I get that this could  conceivably enable filtering timeline ads, but seriously they can just pull API keys for apps that do that, it&#x27;s a non-issue.<p>2. Let me subscribe to ideas, not just people. If I <i>do</i> care about the super bowl, maybe let me turn on push notifications for tweets about it from people within my network for whom I otherwise do not have push notifications enabled.<p>3. Make chronological timelines a setting. Not an option, not a tab, a semi-permanently enabled <i>setting</i>. It&#x27;s the most annoying thing about Facebook right now, having to explicitly re-enable chronological timelines every week or so when Facebook has &quot;forgotten&quot;. As it stands, even that much is an improvement over Twitter&#x27;s proposed always-on non-chronological timeline.<p>4. Don&#x27;t nanny me unless I ask you to. There have been reports that Twitter has blocked notifications for @replied tweets because Twitter suspected the tweet would be offensive. I get that harassment is an issue and that Twitter was trying to be proactive, but make it an option. The user in this case was failing to be notified of tweets they <i>wanted</i> to see, and had no way to disable the &quot;feature&quot;.<p>5. Inconsistency foments distrust. If you want that blue check mark to mean something then you&#x27;d best lay out a solid and strict process for them. I&#x27;ve seen at least one person have theirs removed over unsubstantiated claims, yet more egregious offenders have kept theirs throughout. I&#x27;ve seen others go through the process for acquire their blue checks and they always seem to have different requirements.

The mapping data industry has huge competition right now.  We&#x27;re not even in the same realm of consideration for &quot;regulation&quot; of an API.  That is ridiculous.<p>The simple reality is that Google can control in any way shape or form how their API is consumed.

It is also possible to license the JDK source from Oracle under the commercial license for a fee. The same JDK is also released under the GPL. This license is completely free and unencumbered (the GPL itself prohibits any restrictions). It does not require compatibility (unless you want to call the result &quot;Java&quot;), and has no field of use restrictions. It also has a full (implicit) patent grant. As this article notes, OpenJDK&#x27;s copyleft is not viral either (certainly not more than Linux): applications and libraries running on top of it are unaffected due to the &quot;classpath exception&quot;. You can do <i>whatever you like</i> with Java when you use it under the terms of its open-source license: use the implementation, use just the APIs and implement it yourself, use the whole thing or just small portion, pass the TCK, not pass the TCK, fork it or not. You are even allowed to use it to implement .NET.<p>Google has had both of these options for licensing Java (at least since May 2007, but that was still before Android was released). Until very recently, Google chose neither. They couldn&#x27;t reach an agreement with Sun on the fee for the first license, and didn&#x27;t like the second (possibly because they feared that phone manufacturers would reject a GPL runtime, classpath exception or no). Instead, they chose to argue in court that the APIs are not Oracle&#x27;s to license[1].<p>What has changed now? Perhaps Google realized that given Android&#x27;s success, phone vendors would swallow whatever license Google gives them. In any event this is a win for everyone: Google wins because they will need to spend less resources on maintaining Android, Oracle wins because Java will now be on Android, and Android and Java developers win because they&#x27;ll have a better runtime and greater compatibility. This is contingent, however, on Google not forking OpenJDK too much beyond compatibility; the license does allow them to do so.<p>Yes, the mainline OpenJDK project is steered by the JCP (Google, Intel, Twitter, and IBM are all members) and Oracle does have veto power, but that is just the project governance. Anyone is free to fork OpenJDK, as long as they don&#x27;t call the result Java (unless they fork and choose to pass the TCK). The situation is no different from other large open-source projects.<p>[1]: I have no opinion on whether or not Google&#x27;s actions were legally justified (I do have an opinion about their ethics), but I do know that unlike  Google&#x27;s PR line, the ruling has little or no effect on the industry. Google&#x27;s actions with Java&#x27;s APIs were quite different from any other API implementation that I know of. Also, the ruling does not apply to web APIs.

2015-11-28 01:52:41,Telegram stalking,"I&#x27;ve been more and more concerned about Telegram recently. Here&#x27;s a mail I sent them recently covering most of these concerns. Naturally, I got no response.<p>&quot;
Hey there Telegram!<p>I have been an early Telegram user since late 2013 and was highly optimistic that it would become a perfect messenger.
It&#x27;s quite perfect from a UX point of view – which is important to gain users – but other things aren&#x27;t that perfect.<p>You claim to be open and secure, but taking a closer look that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true. Your API is open and the client apps were released as open source, but your server-side code remains closed source. It&#x27;s been 2 years now and you still haven&#x27;t open sourced the server. Do you still plan to release it? You say that you will eventually add paid options, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be compatible to open-sourcing the server.<p>Of course one would have to trust you that you actually use that version of the server on your side, which leads to the second issue that concerns me. You advertise being secure a lot, but default chats don&#x27;t use end-to-end encryption and secure chats aren&#x27;t even possible for group chats. Even for encrypted chats a bunch of concerns were raised by much respected people in the security community, I&#x27;m sure you are aware of that and will not brag about that here.<p>I opened an issue on the Android app&#x27;s issue tracker in early 2014 about end-to-end encryption (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;9SfYt"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;9SfYt</a>). There have been dozens of comments on that issue, discussing how it could be implemented but there was no official reply by the Android maintainer or any official Telegram account, despite numerous attempts.<p>The Android app&#x27;s maintainer also doesn&#x27;t seem to understand version control &#x2F; git and commits tons of changes in a single commit and also doesn&#x27;t use tags for versioning. He also doesn&#x27;t merge pull requests but rather includes them in his large commits (thus also removing all attribution). There are also binary blobs in the source code and there are various licensing issues. All these issues have been raised but the Android maintainer doesn&#x27;t seem to care about it.<p>The issue tracker for that app has now been closed by the maintainer and there was no explanation for this. Several people tried several times to reach out to the maintainer, but he never replied. I believe this is a huge problem for a security app, and for open source apps in general.<p>Last but not least, the current version of Telegram on the Google Play Store (3.2.4) is not open source.<p>Of course, client apps don&#x27;t have anything to do with the server implementation, API, or general issues about Telegram. You&#x27;ve linked a Trello board somewhere deep on your website, but the link is broken. It&#x27;s a major issue that there is no way to discuss problems, feature requests, or ask questions to the developers (we don&#x27;t even know who the developers are). There is a community-run Telegram support account and a press contact and there&#x27;s this email address and a Twitter account. Obviously none of these work as a discussion &#x2F; issue platform, and you don&#x27;t seem to reply to Telegram questions or Twitter.<p>A very good way to fix this is creating an organization account on GitHub and create a repo where you can use the issue tracker and wiki. You could also move the &quot;official&quot; clients to that account to have them at one place and you could use it to open-source or document other things related to Telegram.<p>It&#x27;s also not clear at all who runs Telegram. All your website says is that it&#x27;s financially supported by Pavel Durov and technically supported by Nikolai Durov. Your official apps and AS Networks are registered by &quot; Telegram Messenger LLP&quot; or &quot;Telegram LLP&quot; and your website claims your headquarters are based in Berlin, although no such company seems to be registered in the EU. You are legally required to publish your address and contact information to comply with German law §5 TMG. Additionally, both the LLP&#x27;s and Nikolai&#x27;s address are apparently at (different) British P.O. boxes.
Is Nikolai the only developer or are there more? How are the official maintainers related to the LLP? Are they paid? Are they employees? Are there any employees at all? Who runs the company?<p>I&#x27;m really trying to not hate you and hope that you are what you claim to be, but it seems like you advertise security and openness successfully, so that the average user and the press buys it, but taking a closer look you seem rather shady without being very open. I feel very sad about this and hope you&#x27;ll improve that.<p>Please shed some light and address these issues, most importantly a public issue tracker &#x2F; discussion forum.<p>Thank you!

You have to grow users, add features, etc, etc. So even if you have an API or something useful it likely won&#x27;t scale economically.  Unless it&#x27;s government supported or behind a foundation of some sort. The Twitter API comes to mind here.<p>2 - This is tricky because for the web to meet the UNIX philosophy, everyone has to agree.  You can&#x27;t have the team that manages the equivalent of the `ls` website decide to change their output, or strike up a deal with the `diff` team to force `diff3` out.<p>Once again, capitalism ruins everything fun.

Netflix, Twitter, FB, Google and others have changed&#x2F;revoked APIs before with minor to significant impace.<p>This is part of the reason why you shouldn&#x27;t <i>try</i> to make applications designed to scale&#x2F;adapt for years... design the simplest thing that does the job, and in as modular a way as possible.

Therefore providing the Sidebar API doesn&#x27;t help because you can&#x27;t expect add-on authors to write code just to make add-ons work better with TST.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;piro_or&#x2F;status&#x2F;635078508981555202"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;piro_or&#x2F;status&#x2F;635078508981555202</a> <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;piro_or&#x2F;status&#x2F;635079271032090624"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;piro_or&#x2F;status&#x2F;635079271032090624</a> <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;piro_or&#x2F;status&#x2F;635079995371556864"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;piro_or&#x2F;status&#x2F;635079995371556864</a>",Twitter

So some company (Summize) created it. Then, Twitter acquired them (actually their first acquisition).<p>Some time later the search method was absorbed into the Twitter API.

2015-08-14 19:28:26,Periscope by the Numbers,"Everything&#x27;s fine, everything said so far here it&#x27;s fine. But I was around here when that happened, which was not that much time ago so I find it weird that you guys don&#x27;t remember.<p>Twitter pulled some very dirty stuff on Meerkat, merely days before launching Periscope and later, in order to favour their own Meerkat clone. That&#x27;s when everything changed from &#x27;it&#x27;s a free market&#x27; to &#x27;it&#x27;s our market and we can kick you out for no reason&#x27;. And yeah, it actually is Twitter&#x27;s market, they are allowed to do anything they like with it and &quot;monopoly regulations&quot; aside, they can kick you out of their for no reason.<p>But let me tell you what I don&#x27;t find ethical about all of this. That when you are going to develop for them, they do not tell you straight away: we are going to fuck you up if what you do turns out to be valuable; quite the contrary, they just put out their &quot;we-are-so-cool-and-we-love-developers&quot; face and invited everyone to be part of their platform blah blah blah.<p>That started around 5-6 years ago, and probably you (selectively) won&#x27;t remember this either, but back then the first killer apps that Twitter had were third-party Twitter clients that made the whole user experience better. They were a hit because back then, too, the main Twitter UX was a piece of s... and these alternatives were so much better. And guess what happened to those products? Twitter pulled the same shit on them, they bought TweetDeck which was arguably the one with the most users (or the one that needed the money the most), and banned all other clients from their API with a week-or-so notice. At that time, that thing was even worse, because I would even dare to say that Twitter somehow was in debt with those developers because a significant contribution to the growth of twitter was driven by people going through all these third-party clients, that&#x27;s plain treachery and there&#x27;s even a special circle in Hell for that thing.<p>Now history repeats again and will repeat forever because the message from Twitter in that sense is very clear: we don&#x27;t give a shit about our developers.<p>But now, it&#x27;s good to see that things are finally turning around. Twitter desperately needs a killer app right now, because they&#x27;ve lost the hype, they&#x27;re running out of money and investors don&#x27;t eat anymore that &quot;we will be profitable in ten years&quot; crap. The only one way that Twitter could be hip again is, oooooh the irony, if another great product starts driving people back into using Twitter, but guess what? No developer will ever take Twitter seriously anymore, and that&#x27;s just and sweet beautiful karma :)<p>Btw, it would be honest for you to disclaim about your relationship with Twitter :^)",Twitter

Maybe I&#x27;m just unaware of them. Anybody know better?<p>I&#x27;d certainly have a better chance of using a Twitter DM app than other IM apps, mainly because between Twitter &amp; SMS I can cover my entire network.<p>There also seems like a reasonable chance that well designed single-purpose apps might attract new &amp; interesting content so open up additional demographics.<p>As an existing user my main gripe with Twitter at the moment is noise.  The spam is worse than ever. The &#x27;targeted&#x27; advertising hasn&#x27;t even reached the uncanny valley. The new retweet-with-comment feature adds pointless clicks to what would otherwise just be a hyperlink. Then there&#x27;s the core problem that Twitter has always had, it&#x27;s users.

In the case of the former, it was by agreement with Twitter: Plume used to be called Touiteur until Twitter made them change it.<p>You&#x27;re seeing it more lately because Google recently changed the Play Store&#x27;s app naming policy to forbid using the name of an existing service as part of your app&#x27;s main brand, only allowing a special clause (e.g. &quot;for [Service]&quot;) following the main brand. Also, around the same time, reddit changed their API policy to add a similar requirement.<p>In the long run, it&#x27;s going to be beneficial for app developers because now they can take their name and use it for apps across multiple services.

2015-06-19 19:58:20,Docker really is the future,"&gt; <i>It&#x27;s humorous that what you just said goes exactly opposite to the blog post, which talks about how docker is designed to do everything completely differently because current methods &quot;don&#x27;t scale&quot;.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s contradictory. We <i>do</i> want Docker to change, for the better, the way applications are built and run. And if you <i>do</i> want to throw away your existing stack and build your next application in the most portable and scalable way possible, then Docker can definitely help. It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> you to, because most people don&#x27;t upgrade everything at once: they improve their toolbox gradually.<p>For example, there is a meme that &quot;if you run more than one process in Docker, you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot;. I actually disagree with that. I think if you want to transpose an existing VM into a container, and think of it as a mini-server that you ssh into, that is your prerogative and Docker should support that use case. Maybe later you will look into the benefits of breaking up your application into smaller, single purpose containers (for example, you can now the Docker API and ecosystem at a finer level of granularity). And when you do, Docker should support that use case too.<p>A small disgression: I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that the tech community feels the need to coalesce around polarizing &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot; statements. I find it particularly unfortunate that <i>Docker</i>, a tool I created partly to make the development world <i>less</i> polarized, was chosen as a battleground for ideological battles that I find frankly boring... Everything doesn&#x27;t have to be a battle.<p>&gt; <i>Keep up the good work on docker though, it seems to be getting some good traction so far! I&#x27;m personally wondering if it&#x27;s more fashion based traction though, and someone will be inventing the next &quot;docker, but more buzzword&quot; before long.</i><p>Thanks.<p>Obviously it will be hard for me to answer that in an unbiased way. I think the &quot;fashion&quot; aspect is a matter of perspective. From the point of view of heavy Hacker News and Twitter users, there is a lot of hype, both positive and negative. But the huge majority of Docker users don&#x27;t hang out on Hacker News (if they even know what it is). They have a job to do, Docker helps them do that job, and they tell their friends and colleagues about it.<p>We&#x27;ve tried to invite as many real-world users of Docker at next week&#x27;s Dockercon, to talk about their experiences, both good and bad. Maybe watch a few of their presentations and decide for yourself if it feels like &quot;fashion&quot; :)",Twitter

2015-05-23 15:26:36,F-Droid Dropping Firefox,"Let me address some issues on this thread on the best way I can because I am really tired of all the FUD and attacks. I will first address the stuff mentioned on that changelog about the FDroid build of fennec and then I will talk a bit about Mozilla, Eich and what I think people are doing wrong in here.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Tests [not sure about that]
  Removed: Crashreporter [tracking]
  Removed: Healthreporter (UI?)
  </code></pre>
All that stuff provides telemetry for Mozilla that helps in finding and addressing bugs. People complain about a website not working correctly on Firefox but disable all the reporting stuff and never fill a bug on bugzilla. That kind of thing is useful. The source code for that is available on github, you can check what is sent and decide if it is worth using it or not.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Mediastreaming (requires non-free library: play-services) [google&#x27;s binary blobs]
  </code></pre>
Users want stuff to work. I am not talking about users with a free software mindset that are willing to hop through unfortunate hops to get their system working. I am talking about the average non-technical non-aware-of-foss user which number in the millions world wide (billions?) They want their browser to be able to play multimedia content. If you don&#x27;t want to use non-free multimedia then don&#x27;t access mp3 and other patent encumbred content.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Updater [tracking]
  </code></pre>
Another piece that you can check the code. Everyone wants an evergreen browser that receives patches, keeps its health in check and is kept up to date. There is no way of updating software without sending some data about the current software. Check the code and see if there is any sensitive information being sent and decide for yourself.<p><pre><code>  Removed: EME&#x2F;DRM [adobe&#x27;s binary blob]
  </code></pre>
EME is one thing and DRM is another. They work together but they are not a single unity. Before EME&#x2F;DRM you had proprietary unauditable DRM software running wild on your computing device. Now you have an open source sandbox that can be audited to make sure that the proprietary DRM blob can&#x27;t escape and fetch personal fingerprint data from your computing device. If you don&#x27;t believe that the EME&#x2F;DRM sandbox included in your Firefox is the same as the one from the code, there are mechanisms for building your own and using it. And thats the important part: &quot;If you are against DRM then don&#x27;t using services that use DRM&quot;. Some people want to listen to music, watch movies and other multimedia on services that believe that DRM solves some stuff. EME&#x2F;DRM solution protects their personal data while giving them the features needed to use such services. If you don&#x27;t agree with DRM then you don&#x27;t use those services. The DRM blob is downloaded when you use those services, if you&#x27;re not using them then the blob is not on your machine and never will be.<p>The fight against DRM shouldn&#x27;t happen inside the browser but in the users mindset and towards the service providers. The EME&#x2F;DRM solution was created as a compromise, give the users what they want while trying the best solution to protect them. Let FSF and other FOSS entitites audit the EME&#x2F;DRM sandbox. Let researchers try to pick personal data and fingerprints from the machine. Match that against the other solution which is non auditable. If all the effort and action placed into the hate machine against EME&#x2F;DRM was instead directed at educating users and teaching about non-DRM services then EME&#x2F;DRM would not be needed.<p>And that brings us to the topic of action. Mozilla is the only large player in the browser ecosystem that has all its code open, its roadmaps published, its processess available for public perusal and collaboration. You can&#x27;t influence or be a part of Safari, Opera, IE, Edge and Chrome development. You can&#x27;t verify, audit, help steer, be a part of what the companies behind those products want for the the web.<p><pre><code>  THE WEB IS THE ONLY MASS COMMUNICATION MEDIA WHERE EVERYONE HAS A VOICE
  </code></pre>
Keeping the web free and open, made by everyone for everyone, is the mission of Mozilla. That mission passes through a lot of different efforts which you can help. Millions of people worldwide have no idea how to the web works and don&#x27;t know how to produce content and make their voice available online.<p>The Mozilla Webmaker project helps teaching the web through workshops. Instead of spreading FUD and attacking people online, you can direct your energy into positive actions such as educating users on how to make the web their own and how to make their opinion count such as when talking about the DRM situation. The webmaker initiative goes beyond that with workshops and activities to teach about privacy, online rights, net neutrality, information credibility, programming. All that is open and in need of help. Educating users do more about the web than removing EME&#x2F;DRM API hooks and sandbox.<p>Firefox is the only browser that has its source code completely open and where you can help steer the project. You can be a part of Mozilla and then join the thousands that are trying to steer the web towards the users. If you don&#x27;t agree with some practice, then, instead of shouting on Twitter and Hacker News, join the mailing lists and discussions. Be a part of the process. Help.<p>Firefox OS is the only mobile operating system developed in the open and based on web technologies that are not controlled by a single entity. You can help us create a wonderful mobile system that brings the benefits of the open web in the hands of everybody. Instead of rooting and fighting about isolated closed proprietary islands, you can help steer our little web boat. Our low-cost (and low-specs :-P ) devices are bringing internet access to lots of people in emerging countries, with that there is information sharing, education, and other life transforming opportunities that bring positive social change.<p>Mozilla is what we make it be. As volunteers, employees, fans and users we can make it more than it ever was. Mozilla is also a project, an idea, that making a good quality software and solutions as a foundation&#x2F;community we can rival companies and make the ideal of values over profit prevail on the web.<p>I see a lot of hate for all the decisions Mozilla makes. Apparently it is the fashionable trendy thing on the web to spread FUD instead of taking positive action and helping. The whole situation with Brendan Eich is one of those cases. Brendan is a normal human being like all of us. We all have our flaws, prejudices, qualities, dreams, and bad decisions. Everyone here has some opinion and action taken about such opinion that goes against something that is deeply important to some group. We&#x27;re humans, we make mistakes. We&#x27;re products of the zeitgeist of our formative years. We learn and change through time but yet we all make mistakes at the eyes of others and sometimes even to our own. Unlike many here, I&#x27;ve been around Brendan Eich couple times and he was always pleasant, supportive and energetic about the web. That is his passion and fight. A strong problem with the web is the echo chamber. Someone makes a mistake or something we all disagree and consider bad and that person is forever bound to suffer our hate. That kind of action leads us nowhere. Whats helps is education, empathy, showing &quot;the other&quot; why we thing our opinion is important and why we would think another course of action was correct. Dialog and comprehension makes the world a better place, pitchforks don&#x27;t.<p>You all here, may you be FUDing&#x2F;fear mongering or not, can help Mozilla, the Web, Brendan and everyone. You can join the cause of an open web though dialog and positive actions. You can help Mozilla better its code and actions. You can help teach people about the web and let them multiply their opportunities. You can help audit code, translate content, make us see the correct path when we&#x27;re in the dark. You can help Mozilla fight for a web made of people and not of incompatible features and companies.<p>Thats what I am asking. Instead of flamewars and fighting Mozilla, join us, help us work, teach and learn with us and we&#x27;ll all make a much better and interesting web.",Twitter

Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, GMail, HN, the government all should allow you to easily link your identity. This should be a normal part of your account creation (this can tie in nicely with another change: getting rid of passwords and using a browser UI for identifying yourself a la Persona, but PGP based).  Basically when signing up for Twitter, it should optionally let you upload one of your public keys (via a nice browser UI no less). Twitter (Facebook, GMail, etc.) would then expose a nice API for querying by public key fingerprint: &quot;Who has 0xDEADBEEF?&quot; =&gt; &quot;@DeadBeef&quot;. Revocation, key updates, all that should be automatic: you revoke your public key and issue a replacement, all your services update automatically.<p>This is the point where lots of people will raise concerns about privacy: &quot;This means Twitter now must have access to my GMail account! WTF?!&quot;. No. This process must be voluntary and optional. If you want to have 200 different identities online, go for it. I don&#x27;t care to know your real name, I just care to know that I am talking only to the person I intend to talk to. Think emailing a well known developer on GitHub, having never met them. You don&#x27;t need their real name, you are only interested in them in so far as they publish OSS on GitHub. This allows you to prove that github.com&#x2F;example is @example on Twitter, example@example.com, example@gmail.com, and HN user &quot;example&quot;.<p>And the benefit to &quot;regular Joe&quot; is that when he emails his accountant, he can now send his credit card number and SSN without fear of eavesdropping.",Twitter
2015-02-25 07:35:04,"How to Be a Programmer: A Short, Comprehensive, and Personal Summary","&gt; <i>Learn to touch-type. This is an intermediate skill because writing code is so hard that the speed at which you can type is irrelevant and can&#x27;t put much of a dent in the time it takes to write code, no matter how good you are. However, by the time you are an intermediate programmer you will probably spend a lot of time writing natural language to your colleagues and others. This is a fun test of your commitment; it takes dedicated time that is not much fun to learn something like that. Legend has it that when Michael Tiemann[2] was at MCC people would stand outside his door to listen to the hum generated by his keystrokes which were so rapid as to be indistinguishable.</i><p>I know that this piece wasn&#x27;t written that long ago (2003)...but thinking back on those days of programming, I believe that so much has changed in information availability and operating systems that while fast touch-typing is still just an intermediate benefit, being able to memorize shortcuts and execute them by touch is of <i>enormous</i> benefit.<p>What I mean is that while Google was good in 2003, now I can type in an error message and basically be assured that the relevant Stack Overflow question will come up. Or maybe not, so I pop up a couple of Google searches, tabbing between windows as I type in my query. As those load up, I Alt-tab to my terminal window to re-run the problematic command, or at least examine it for typos. By then, at least one of my Google queries will have finished, so I Alt-Tab to my browser, click one of the search results, then Alt-Tab to the other Google query, click on one of <i>its</i> results. By this point, the Google search results that I skimmed over, or perhaps from the OneBox&#x2F;Direct Answer, has given me an idea to what my problem was. So while waiting for the actual pages linked from Google to load up, I alt-tab back into Terminal to see if any of those hints apply. If not, Alt-Tab to the browser, etc. etc.<p>Today I was teaching a student how to work with Twitter data from the command-line...and because Bash is not ideal for doing math or for parsing multi-line data...it took me a few tries of tabbing into a Bash reference manual, and many taps of the Up&#x2F;History key, and Ctrl-A&#x2F;Ctrl-E to navigate the prompt line, to come up with the command to calculate someone&#x27;s rate of Tweets (after hitting the API with a command-line program)...to the student, it must have looked like a constant stream of actual coding to get to the answer, when in fact, it was just a flurry of stupid mistakes and fixes in a span of a few seconds.<p>In the past, when a book was still often the best reference, or a very long webpage explanation...being able to quickly navigate the operating system may have not been such a big deal, as you were better served by just stopping your coding work to just read. Now (just as with all aspects of life and society), there seems to be a greater need to quickly navigate and filter information. I guess it&#x27;s a sort of multi-tasking...which may not always be ideal, but it is much <i>less</i> ideal if you&#x27;re multi-tasking and using your mouse to get around.",Twitter

An API for email clients which pull data as they wish would be nice, instead of the current broadcast all the data model. This plus identity would make it easier to block spam.<p>HTML with inline CSS for styling (clients could strip to plain text as required, not send the message twice) - no JS for obvious reasons.

I was floored.  Technology meant nothing to these wealthy people.<p>I realized that the people who ran the sports books were so lazy and incompetent that they would never understand what convex optimization was and that If I instead committed to learning how to bet, I would eventually grind millions of dollars out of their archaic systems.  Quite simply, anyone with enough commitment and resources can outsmart the index.<p>Its not that they were dolts, but that their focus was not on math and better real-time odds; the focus was on bilking very poor bettors out of their money and preying on them as much as possible.  These guys just worked 9 to 5 collected fat paychecks, basically work in palaces with sweet perks, and abhorred (and scoffed) change of any kind.<p>Once I realized that being smart and capable would never sell, it was an elementary decision.

2014-11-04 15:32:23,Why Twitter Can't Replace RSS,"Twitter can serve as a replacement for a subset of RSS functionality, but even allowing for Twitter to grow that subset, the biggest difference is architectural:<p>Tweets all run through twitter.com and your ability to retrieve the tweets you want or for the content owners to provide the information they wish depends on Twitter&#x27;s continued willingness to provide the tools and&#x2F;or API to do so and to allow you both to keep your accounts. Even assuming they will always want to facilitate this sort of thing and that neither you nor the content owners will do something to get kicked off Twitter, you can be sure that the tools and API will change relatively rapidly over the years ahead.<p>Meanwhile RSS is (usually) hosted on the content owner&#x27;s server. The format has been stable for 15+ years at this point. Tools that worked for aggregating and dealing with RSS in 2000 still work today. And only your ISP could potentially stop you from retrieving the content you wish, when you want it, how you want to.",Twitter

The products feel to me more like the product of brainstorming at an ad agency than a mature response to necessity. London&#x27;s design scene is full of this kind of &quot;creative&quot; activity, and it&#x27;s super enjoyable to watch but probably a form of decline or decadence in terms of real manufacturing and craft.

2014-07-14 02:11:22,Hardware Case Study: Why Lockitron Has Taken So Long To Ship,"Wow, you are all over this thread. I take issue with the way you are jumping in here with a lot of assumptions. Please give me a moment to respond to your assertions point by point.<p>There is nothing glamorous about airing our faults and where we went wrong along the way, the points you enumerate were our beliefs to a &#x27;T&#x27; when we launched our second product a year and a half ago. A handful of these are right while others are mostly wrong or misguided.<p>1) This is a tough one to address. I see elsewhere in this thread you made the same mistake we did - namely thinking we could get 2mA with PS-POLL. While possible in the lab, that is simply not the case when working under conditions we&#x27;ve seen in the wild. Hypothetically if that were true you could see near instantaneous WiFi all the time. We were optimistic this may be possible but didn&#x27;t want to bet on it. We made the call that WiFi is advertised with instant response when someone is at the door and delayed response when in power save mode. If there is confusion we are quick to correct on Facebook, Twitter, and even our own blog[1]. Firmware updates to our WiFi chipset look promising but we are not committing to this.<p>2) Determining intent is a hard problem but hardly a fool&#x27;s errand. We don&#x27;t do this through just one BLE radio using RSSI alone as your comment implies[2]. The examples you give are both solvable with what we&#x27;ve built today. The harder problems come from platform inconsistency between iPhone and Android API&#x27;s. Android for instance only recently announced BLE support and when they did, the phone could only operate in one out of the two roles. Clearly other companies think similar home vs away intent is worth developing too[3][4].<p>3) Building a proper prototype without functional mechanicals is insane. Don&#x27;t do this. The other huge rabbit hole here is the word &#x27;reliably.&#x27; It&#x27;s like a client of a web design firm asking for 100% uptime.[5] The best you should do at the &#x27;hardware startup making a prototype&#x27; phase is to get it working on your target platform and solve known bugs so it works for 90 to 99.9% with loose specs or 100% of the time under tight optimal conditions. That said, things change. The way we were doing BLE security when we launched was thought to be secure. A ShmooCon talk instilled some doubts that while not broken it may not be the best foundation [6]. We rebuilt a lot of that with Diffie-Hellman and HMAC instead. We saw some connectivity issues with the new approach that were subsequently addressed. Other things change too. Our BLE chip switched from not using signed licenses to using signed licenses between updates. This caused us a bunch of frustration.<p>4) 40 hours of work to review a design is probably too little. We spent closer to 300 hours on the EE side with the most senior hacker we knew [7]. We worked with another firm on mechanics for 11 months prior to launch. In retrospect that feels about right for how much weight mechanical problems are vs electrical.<p>That $25-$30 number you site IS misleading. As an analogy, it is almost certainly possible to build a robot which can walk a straight line across a plastic table for this but getting it to walk across arbitrary terrain will cost you if your operating specs are unbounded (think Mars rover.) We know how to build a device that fits over locks for $25 without PCB - we are not happy with what level of performance that gets us.<p>5) This product however is not designed to be a replacement lock. We have made one of those in the past[8]. Saying something is wrong&#x2F;inefficient is true for anything asked to do something other than what it is made for. This model of Lockitron is designed to fit over a wide variety of existing locks precisely so that it can work for renters who can not change their locks. It is designed to do it in a way that it does not requires you to take your lock apart so it can be installed quickly and with next to zero mechanical aptitude. It does these things insanely well.<p>The numbers you site for gear vendors are again misleading. Yes, one can get gears for this cost in this time but you are shifting the burden of development and tooling elsewhere. Making this tradeoff in this case gets us towards a local maxima that is not the product&#x27;s desired function.<p>6) This is a bit naive. You don&#x27;t build to the spec if you&#x27;re seeing different results in the field. We saw this to be the case with sticky locks and jammy door frames. Other new locks can be put on a clean installation, we have to work with what&#x27;s there. Similarly, the Bluetooth 4.0 and 4.1 specs promise a lot of things which neither Apple nor Android support. In this case we build for what effects our customers experience not a certification checkbox - especially when that means exceeding the certifications standards.<p>And if anything that is the takeaway here. Building something to spec is a finite task with an estimable amount of work and calculable delivery date. Having real world conditions conflict with what was spec&#x27;ed introduces delays. Having conflicts across your product from metals and plastics up to software interfaces means these delays propagate.<p>You make the tough calls. You ship.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.lockitron.com/post/84539548097/debugging-jams-wifi-battery-notifications"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.lockitron.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;84539548097&#x2F;debugging-jams-wi...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://community.lockitron.com/t/sense-will-it-sense-if-my-phone-is-inside-or-outside-of-the-house/161/3?u=pmg"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.lockitron.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;sense-will-it-sense-if-my-p...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://developer.nest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nest.com&#x2F;</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://blog.dropcam.com/tag/dropcam-alerts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.dropcam.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;dropcam-alerts&#x2F;</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/316637/100-uptime-for-a-web-application"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;serverfault.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;316637&#x2F;100-uptime-for-a-web...</a>\n[6] <a href=""https://lacklustre.net/bluetooth/"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lacklustre.net&#x2F;bluetooth&#x2F;</a>\n[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Felsenstein"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lee_Felsenstein</a>\n[8] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2011/05/lockitron-unlock-your-home-with-your-cellphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;lockitron-unlock-your-home-with...</a>",Twitter
2014-07-10 12:51:05,Show HN: Free Social Network For Geeks,"Hi, I am the creator of OtakuJam, and this is my first post on HN. I am looking for testers to help me test and fine tune my new social network project. I am also offering a contest for active members which ends next month for a $20 amazon gift card as a little incentive to help me gain some much needed testers.<p>Otakujam is a new social network (built on the buddypress engine) aimed at helping geeks connect with other geeks both online and off. It has entered open beta on 5&#x2F;27&#x2F;14 and is seeking testers to help suggest new features and test existing features.<p>It offers many familiar social networking features such as an activity stream where users can post updates, share photos and videos, and share and comment on other users&#x27; activities.<p>You can friend other users, or choose to follow them instead - the difference being that a follow does not require a confirmation from the other user. Users have complete control over their privacy levels and can choose which profile fields to make public, hide completely, or show to friends only.<p>The site&#x27;s main feature is &quot;Otaku Match&quot; which is a matchmaking script that allows users to search for other geeks based on the information included in their profiles.  All of the profile fields and data are customized to be of high relevancy to geek culture and include things such as a user&#x27;s favorite anime, or what books they are reading, or their favorite board games. Users&#x27; profile text is automatically converted into hyper links which when clicked, will take you to a page which displays other users who share these interests.<p>Most recently (in early July) OtakuJam began to focus on curated news content from geeky-related RSS feeds. It also added the ability for members of this social network to add their own articles, game reviews, and editorials which will appear on the site&#x27;s front page and news sections, as well as in a personal blog that each user can access via their OtakuJam profile. I have plans to add many game reviews and editorials myself over time, but mainly right now, there&#x27;s a lot of curated news more so than original content. Hopefully as time goes on and we get more active members, this will change and become a more balanced arena for news from the web as well as fresh original content.<p>Users can also join and create groups or participate in chat rooms or forums with other members. There&#x27;s also an events section where users can post and search for offline real world events which allows users to search as close as 5 miles or up to 100 miles from any given location.<p>Users can easily update their OtakuJam profiles by connecting to any of their social media accounts such as importing their instagram or flickr updates into Otakujam, or being able to use twitter to tweet out their OtakuJam status updates. Status updates can include hashtags and mentions which work similar to twitter in that they alert the person mentioned or help index content based on topic tags.<p>New features are being added constantly and a few upcoming features include the ability to watch streaming anime content and a steam api integration to display your games and achievements.<p>If any of this should happen to interest you we would love to see you join up on the site. Even if you decide not to join, if you have any feedback to give about the site, feel free to share it here in the comments.<p>Thanks for taking time to view my post, and have a happy Thursday :)",Twitter
2014-07-05 12:54:06,Farewell Node.js,"I think the issue is we&#x27;ve been slowly accepting that the node  is the right way to do things. Five years of working with someone will do that to you. If you follow me on twitter you probably see me complain about it in various ways all the time, it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m bored with it, node&#x27;s problems are real and some people just seem to ignore them, or maybe just deal with them because they know backwards compat can&#x27;t be broken immediately. It has always bothered me that people would advocate such broken systems (streams etc) when real-world alternatives were better even before now, even C has a much better example of what a stream should be.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not the only one writing large systems, but I think the tolerance level varies per developer. Also plenty of people make a living&#x2F;name from Node, of course they&#x27;re more likely to praise it than to be honest about its faults, I&#x27;m definitely a minority in that respect. Having broken concepts is one thing, but resisting change when they&#x27;re obviously broken is not a good thing. Many of these same people make money from consultation, where it&#x27;s advantageous to have a broken system. I&#x27;m not trying to screw them over but someone has to be honest.<p>It took years to get .addHeader() in because no one in core believed in a progressive API, they didn&#x27;t use node in real-world applications to see the need. This still happens all the time, take npm-www for example, Isaac is a rad guy but him aswell as most other &quot;core&quot; community members advocated building tiny little things and stitching them all together, and just recently realized that in practice this doesn&#x27;t scale, thus ended up going with Hapi. This lack of insight is all over Node as a community.<p>It&#x27;s hard to describe well, but I hope people will try Go (or similar alternative), you&#x27;ll really see how much more robust it is. If node fixed its conceptually flawed event system, rewrote http so it wasn&#x27;t awful to work with, and fixed streams then we&#x27;d have a pretty good system to work with. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to pass off problems with node as problems you&#x27;d have with any platform, but that&#x27;s unfortunately just not reality.",Twitter
2014-06-30 02:31:39,Tesla Model S JSON API,"As with a lot of things in REST, the answer lies...in your browser. How did you know how to answer that last comment? You clicked a link for it. Not everything about REST can be answered by &quot;just look at your browser&quot;, but a lot of things can.<p>If you follow a link you don&#x27;t care what the URL is. You never needed to type out &quot;&#x2F;reply&quot; to use Hacker News, you don&#x27;t need to do it to use an API. That&#x27;s what the article is about.<p>The actual URL is unimportant, you just need to know what the link for &quot;&#x2F;api&#x2F;vehicle&quot; returns to do something useful with it. Like you knew that &quot;&#x2F;reply&quot; would give you a form with a place to type out a reply.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t even know how I&#x27;d write a client against a server that arbitrarily changes endpoint URIs.<p>The thing is, you don&#x27;t have to. I can write one for you and you&#x27;ll never need to write another one again. You could use it and just have to implement the part that matters to your application, the semantic of it. You wouldn&#x27;t need to hardcode anything, or even handle URIs at all.<p>You could use it for Tesla&#x27;s API, Twitter&#x27;s, Facebook&#x27;s, whatever. If they used links you could use the exact same client for anyone, just needing to re-write the logic part (like creating a post on Facebook, a tweet on Twitter, etc).<p>Problem is hardly anyone actually implements links so you can&#x27;t do that. It sounds like utopia but it&#x27;s just the product of extreme decoupling. It&#x27;s not really any different than browsers.",Twitter
2014-06-29 18:10:05,What's an idea or creation that you've had success with locally that I can copy?,"well, none of these are really implemented (yet) but here you go<p>SW Only<p>1) An all-in-one transport app. You&#x27;d have a single credit wallet you could re-charge on a monthly&#x2F;weekly&#x2F;as-needed basis. You set in your profile for how long you are willing to wait for a ride(lets say +&#x2F;- 15min), and how far are you willing to walk from your current location(lets say r500m) + other criteria if you please(like ferraries-only:). Rates could be something like few cents&#x2F;km for &quot;civilian&quot; drivers(standard car-sharing - could be problematic depending on the legislature&#x2F;generated profit for the driver), few bucks&#x2F;km for cabs, pub transport based on routes&#x2F;times and - dynamic pub transport routes per km as well. Lets say there is a after-work beer with colleagues planned so you can&#x27;t drive to work by your self. During breakfast you just choose a destination(predefined for freq. places), desired time and a &quot;hitchhiker sign&quot;. All drivers doing the same&#x2F;similar route(with criteria compatible with yours) would be notified .. a few &quot;accept&quot; clicks away&#x2F;maybe a quick look at the drivers profile(badges&#x2F;km driven&#x2F;reviews etc) and your off to work. No drivers available? Your app would show you all public transport possibilities(color coded based on compatibility with your criteria) + cabs in your area - few clicks away and you&#x27;re set(either buying a ticket or ordering a cab). Double-validation for payments based on transport type - no more waiting on a bus stop for 2 hours watching 100&#x27;s of driver-only empty cars going your direction + a public API would mean that bus companies could also use small 6-8 passenger buses and dynamically create new&#x2F;amend existing routes based on the demand(200 people heading to a business park across town(C) from destination A, 100 from B to D(which is near C) between 0800 - 0900 &gt; change route via B .. if time intervals are met(like 1h from A - C) ) ++ all the data flowing your direction could also be used as a waze alternative for even better routing +++ you could profit by selling api data&#x2F;on % from commercial transport partners) + have awards for car-share folks like free oil&#x2F;filter changes after 10k km&#x2F;free coffee after 20km between 2200 - 0600 etc..). If you are in EU, these projects are highly welcomed..<p>2) We need a distributed decentralized(p2p), no-authority write once read many storage solution for &quot;our civilizations data&quot; like news&#x2F;general knowledge. It has to support versioning, encryption, deduplication, store synapses between relevant data, be self-healing, layered, nodes monitoring&#x2F;promoting(demoting)&#x2F;caranteening each other if needed, role-based - build on premise that all* of the nodes are&#x2F;can become malicious actors(..).

2014-06-24 04:56:43,Goodbye Heroku,"I don&#x27;t think you are in any position to decide what I do or do not have a strong understanding of. Let&#x27;s break down your thoughts:<p>1.) Downtime - You seemed to gloss over my primary point. The downtime today could have been completely avoided if Heroku did not opt to do a 2pm EST scheduled maintenance. This was a very large risk they took and it blew up in everyone&#x27;s face.<p>As far as resolving downtime. I stand by my original statement that a PaaS like Heroku cannot recover as fast on average as another solution. They have too many customers that they have to get up and running.<p>5) Buildpacks - I&#x27;ve been fielding this one on Twitter all day and am considering writing another blog post. I didn&#x27;t really give much weight to this one and that opens it up to attack pretty easily. Here is my point:<p>Buildpacks in general do not suck. Heroku&#x27;s implementation of Buildpacks sucks. Customizing Heroku buildpacks is a nightmare. Maintaining said fork is nearly impossible. There is no versioning of the buildpacks. There is no way to know if&#x2F;when slugs are updated and my fork is no longer useable or needs to merge in upstream changes. Getting anything into the official buildpacks is a political nightmare. Adding CLI tools not in the heavily stripped down Ubuntu AMI is a gigantic pain in the ass.<p>But if that is not enough for you I&#x27;ll end this point with David Dollar who did a ton of work while at Heroku with its buildpacks <a href=""https://twitter.com/ddollar/status/481201978391801857"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ddollar&#x2F;status&#x2F;481201978391801857</a><p>re: puppet - I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re hammering me for Puppet as I never mentioned it. You seemed to assume that this is what we will use.<p>3) Pricing - I dismiss most of your argument unless we&#x27;re talking about Heroku&#x27;s database hosting. Their DB hosting is awesome and top-notch. Their app hosting has become a less than stellar. I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m paying for anymore. To me managed devops means I don&#x27;t ever have to deal with pager duty or I can just hand customers over to someone after we launch their product. That&#x27;s not Heroku, not by a long shot. At best we&#x27;re getting security fixes and system updates applied. At worst we are paying a premium on resold EC2 instances for a deploy shell script that has been freely available for a while now.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you but I don&#x27;t really spend that much time swapping the underlying language. At least not without some heavy consideration, what we go with is usually thought out from the start of the project. To me, I&#x27;m not interested in the least in being able to swap out MRI for JRuby with a change of a line. In nearly 10 years of professional Rails development I have maybe had to do this twice. Upgrading Ruby is a different story, but that is also not something that should be done lightly.<p>Today&#x27;s post was a culmination of years of frustration with the platform. I&#x27;ve had it, we&#x27;re done with it. Moving on. Good riddance.",Twitter
2014-06-05 20:13:22,Twitter in talks to buy online music firm SoundCloud,"It&#x27;s amazing how much effort SC put in making UI more sleek yet degrading UX thoroughly.<p>Stream is useless in its current form. It&#x27;s much inferior to Dashboard (which wasn&#x27;t perfect in the first place, but was quite usable, contrary to that one). For people taking SC activities seriously, like trying to listen most of the tracks coming from people they follow, there must be a way to hide&#x2F;collapse tracks that were already listened to (like removing in dashboard). What about favorites of people I follow? I maybe not use it extensively, but it&#x27;s a great way to discover new tracks. Dashboard provides it all and has a few tabs with different filtering and independent hiding (removing) and I would fix only this independence - removing entry in one tab should be enough and work for the other ones too - and improve the &quot;More&quot; button, to load at once everything that is left.<p>What should be clearly told is that new UI is definitely against any more thorough comments. Come on, showing only a few words? It&#x27;s like you encourage SCers to leave these useless comments. And there is no place for discussion at all. Personally I like to discuss things. Yet I understand others that don&#x27;t like comments at all on SC (because well, they are in fact often completely useless, as lot of SC users can express only praises or nothing), so they should be able to easily hide them.<p>Where are the features that everyone hoped for? Where are the marks next to the tracks that I already commented on them (and how many comments that were)? Where are the marks next to tracks that I already listened to? SoundCloud Next that was turned to be default is still more of a disaster than improvement. And it&#x27;s sad.<p>Somehow this I-don&#x27;t-care-about-UX-but-let&#x27;s-make-it-look-sexier-at-least attitude is becoming quite popular in internet, which is a paradox, because nowadays the opposite mind should be predominant. GitHub did in the last few years similar changes (they had a few good ones too, though) and had to disable comments in their blog to stop the never ending complaints... Another thing: less is more, but too less isn&#x27;t more at all. You have to preserve some basic functionality, otherwise removing features is like slapping users in the face. Here I can give Minus as an example - file sharing site that turned back into media sharing site w&#x2F; most of the features removed.<p>I think about doing some sane front-end using their API, but I always lack time to do stuff after hours...<p>If being bought by Twitter will help SC crew work better on UX, then I really hope it will happen. Otherwise it won&#x27;t really change anything.",Twitter

V8-on-NaCl used to work, I think it may have bitrotted since then, but it used NaCl&#x27;s dyncode modify API to do PIC.

2014-05-19 22:11:54,Famo.us open to everyone,"First famo.us employee here, want to give people some food for thought to consider as you gripe about things like zoom and and the scrollbar (rightfully so). Some of the more controversial points, especially those regarding accessibility and progressive enhancement, made below are my own.<p>I think I&#x27;m the only person at the company that browses the web with JavaScript disabled, so I know how broken the original world wide web from when I first went online in 1994 is. I also remember using text-only browsers like lynx, and demonstrate it to co-workers on occasion. Lastly, I&#x27;ve been doing the web app development schtick for several years now and seen the good and the bad.<p>With all that in mind, the push towards progressive enhancement starting in 2003 when AJAX was just starting to become popular has proven to be a false prophet. IMHO, no idea has done more to make the web less accessible while also holding it back in terms of interactivity. You simply cannot use the same abstraction for both documents and applications and expect decent results for either.<p>What we should have done instead is allowed the two to diverge long ago and especially after 2007 when mobile computing took off and that change in screen size afforded us the opportunity to return to screens not all that dissimilar from those I remember using in &#x27;94. The first iPhone had a effective resolution of 320×480. You can effectively show as much on an iPhone as a 1994 computer monitor and have it be readable on both. In fact that&#x27;s basis of the &quot;Mobile First&quot; design paradigm that frameworks like Zurb Foundation have pushed for. Designing content for a single-wide column that scrolls up and down, that you can jump backward and forward on via anchor hypertext references was a really smart abstraction for lots of content. The site <a href=""http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherfuckingwebsite.com&#x2F;</a> illustrates this poignantly.<p>The technology direction we should have taken should have made sure that search engines, the blind (or otherwise disabled or dexterally challenged) actually remained the first class citizens on the web instead of taking the back seat to print designers and interaction designers. It&#x27;s easy to take the content designed for those constitutents and make it available via APIs that can then be consumed by people making rich web apps.<p>We even had something like that, it&#x27;s called RSS and it is glorious. RSS may have actually survived if it had not been for progressive enhancement which was crap but just good enough that people could get away with killing RSS off. Every technologist should make themselves familiar with the concept of path dependency (this Slate articles on the persistence of rockets as our primary way of putting objects in space is illustrative: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2011/02/space_stasis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slate.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;technology&#x2F;future_tense&#x2F;2011&#x2F;0...</a> ). Had progressive enhancement not become the road taken, no one would have ever argued to kill off RSS in favor of a hack jobbed DOM implemented where maybe 1 in 100 developers actually understood how to actually implement accessibility. RSS and other means of programmatic content consumption would have become the prime way of being indexable by search engines. Everyone would have maintained content that way because it would have been in their self interest to do so. Not only that, progressive enhancement is just usable enough to not get sued under the ADA. Without progressive enhancement, businesses (read: at least every fortune 500 company and then some) would have poured gobs money to into making sure they have the digital equivalent of wheelchair ramps. Progressive enhancement gave everyone the opportunity to do the least amount of effort and still maintain a defensible position if challenged legally.<p>The screen reading experience has been shit for like for ever and it&#x27;s only gotten worse as designs have become more complex. Skipping over the level of abstraction that made content usable programmatically not only impoverished those that need it, but those who don&#x27;t as well because we&#x27;re deprived of richer, more flexible APIs.<p>Having worked with webapps for a while, I think one of the most amazing improvements in the last 5 years has been the move towards displaying content on many more screens than just the desktop. This has forced us to go back to API solutions (usually REST, but sometimes RPC over websockets) that often ape what we originally tried to accomplish with RSS. This is the only sane way to provide content that needs to be displayed in different ways, from a Mobile First single long scroll page rendered by the server to a Famous&#x2F;Ember&#x2F;Angular&#x2F;Backbone&#x2F;React app that takes that server-rendered page and replaces it entirely with a rich interactive experience in the browser.<p>We (at famo.us) don&#x27;t yet have a solution for this future that treats everyone as a first class citizen, but we eventually plan to address this if the community doesn&#x27;t tackle it first. We&#x27;ve been inspired by a few attempts at figuring out how to achieve this. Spike Brehm and crew over at AirBnB have been exploring this with Rendr, that works with Backbone.js, <a href=""https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rendrjs&#x2F;rendr</a> , and August Lilleaas has worked on a solution for React, <a href=""http://augustl.com/blog/2014/jdk8_react_rendering_on_server/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;augustl.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jdk8_react_rendering_on_server&#x2F;</a> . We feel like there is potential for a generalized solution that doesn&#x27;t need to be necessarily tied to how one framework works.<p>If you look deep at Famo.us, we don&#x27;t throw out the DOM wholesale, instead we use the DOM where it matters. In Famo.us, there is a concept of a Surface (which is similar to Layers in CoreAnimation). The Surface is basically a container for HTML Document Fragments, usually fragments that are very strongly structured semantically. The entire scene graph above each Surface node basically helps you programmatically abstract away all the bullshit that many today handle awkwardly with levels and levels of DIV hell controlled by JavaScript. This is not only the abstraction that makes building things in Famo.us easy and fast, but also provides a boundary where content gets lumped into semantic chunks that oftentimes should be consumable for use in a long-scroll, semantically rich, Mobile First design where navigation is hyperlinked anchor based instead of spatial navigation.<p>When browsers were first designed, they made a decision to have a 1 to 1 relationship between the window object and the document object. While reasonable at the time (remember: small screens, low bandwidth, high latency), this proved unscalable to larger screens, greater bandwidth and lower latency. Take Twitter for example. Twitter.com is basically an application for displaying a tiny document called a Tweet. There hundreds of tweet documents shown at a time. The code for tweets is semantically rich. The code for the twitter app? That&#x27;s DIV hell. This is what Famo.us helps with. Like Flash and Silverlight before it, it helps apps be apps, but unlike its predecessors, it allows documents to be documents. Keeping these two separate keeps abstractions from leaking into each other in the code you write.<p>So while some things may be broken, and the way its broken may inspire ire, it&#x27;s important to understand that it&#x27;s not where the puck is that matters, but where it is going. The scrollview we&#x27;ve made is still inferior to the native scroller in a few ways, such as missing keyboard bindings, but are temporary shortcomings that we and the community are going to address in time. Eventually the feature and quality gap will narrow and the Famo.us scrollview(s) will reach parity with native scrollers.<p>Furthermore, some of the abstractions in the Famo.us scroller are remarkable for their programmatic flexibility. When most people think of a scroller, they only think of three scenarios: vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling and a pannable tiled area (like Google Maps or Open Street Maps). This is actually a pretty limited view of what&#x27;s possible to explore if you abstract a scroller to its essence. A scroller at is essential is a mathematical set with a curser and that all scrolling does (whether by mouse or keyboard) is move the cursor position in that set. When you think about it that way, many more things you&#x27;ve seen are scrollers. For example, the Apple Time machine view is a scroller in the Z-direction. CoverFlow is another scroller that is horizontal, but where the affine matrix transform applied to a surface is based on the distance of a surface from the cursor and inverts on each side of the cursor. One team of beta testers used the scroll view to display a DNA double helix. It was basically two position linked vertical-scrollers, where the positioner function didn&#x27;t just set the position on the Y-axis, but also manipulated the affine matrix to create the helix shape.<p>While probably not the best approach, even Google&#x27;s new interactive Rubik&#x27;s cube doodle could probably be implemented as a series of Famo.us scrollers. Each scroller would contain 12 surfaces (doubly linked in a ring), with pagination occurring at every three surfaces. The pagination function instead of translating the surfaces along only one axis instead rotates all the surfaces 90 degrees around an axis. All surfaces would belong to two scrollers &quot;perpendicular&quot; to one another at any given time, being lifted from one to the other and back depending on which one was in motion.<p>And since all this is based on the same scroller, which will eventually reach parity with native scrollers, it means that they get all the same features. Home goes to the top of a vertical scroller, the left of a western horizontal scroller, the beginning of the double helix or the begging of time in z-axis time machine like scroller. End does the opposite.<p>These examples just begin to scratch the surface of what&#x27;s possible when you expose primitives that map to mathematical concepts like a set and current index to developers.<p>Last, but not least, we&#x27;re going to look at all the feedback on the scrollview and try to address all the issues you all have encountered.",Twitter
2014-04-30 21:45:07,Introducing Anonymous Login and an Updated Facebook Login,"What you say is not always true either.<p>I do Python mostly. Django? Fine. It has an excellent auth system out of the box. But that kind of auth system isn&#x27;t very flexible either. Now I barely do Django development today so please excuse me behind any insane changes.<p>Flask and Pyramid world? Custom auth to me. They both have community modules for auth stuff, but do I really like them? I am not the kind of guy just pip install random &quot;useful&quot; package these days. Let&#x27;s give another example. A year or two ago I tried to do social auth in some of my django and flask apps. Maybe I was dumb but using that social-auth library took me a while to get some of login working. Plus, the code was messy and buggy. In the end, I said screw that and implemented all of the custom login myself, just reading the official doc from twitter and facebook. That also took me a while but I knew the whole implementation inside-out. If I don&#x27;t trust my own implement because it is insecure, then I must spend the same amount of time inspecting other people&#x27;s custom modules.<p>The truth is, generic auth system is hard and is not flexible. In fact, too flexible can be a bad thing: <a href=""http://plope.com/pyramid_auth_design_api_postmortem"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;plope.com&#x2F;pyramid_auth_design_api_postmortem</a><p>I like customized auth system based on the api provided by the framework - that&#x27; what makes Pyramid powerful to me.

2014-02-11 19:47:21,Bitcoin withdrawal processing suspended,"The Bitcoin protocol is the Satoshi client; the Satoshi client is the Bitcoin protocol.  No Bitcoin protocol exists outside of the single source of truth, which is &quot;how does the Satoshi client actually operate?&quot;<p>Both exchanges use the JSON&#x2F;RPC interface to the Satoshi bitcoin client.  That is the One True Way to use Bitcoin to develop Bitcoin-consuming applications.  To do otherwise is madness.  (I&#x27;ve seen explanations that Mt. Gox was using a custom client, but I believe they mean &quot;Mt. Gox was using a custom system which took care of bookkeeping for itself, because the Satoshi client cannot operate thousand of wallets in any sane fashion, but used the Satoshi client for interacting with the Bitcoin network.&quot;)<p>The Bitcoin RPC interface exposes many methods.  I don&#x27;t have intimate knowledge of which one these exchanges were using, but since they all have similar issues, let&#x27;s assume they used sendtoaddress.<p>The message signature of sendtoaddress is (pseudo-code):<p><pre><code>   #returns transaction_id\n   sendtoaddress(from_account, to_bitcoin_address, amount, optional_message)  \n</code></pre>\nThe mistake which both exchanges made is they assumed transaction_id is the same transaction_id used for gettransaction(transaction_id).  It is.  If you send a transaction, wait an hour, and then get it by ID, that will work.<p>But it isn&#x27;t.  Transaction ID means absolutely nothing.  It can be changed by any party, worldwide, for up to one hour after the invocation of sendtoaddress.  If you use gettransaction(transaction_id) and it returns nil, that does not prove that the transaction you previously created did not succeed correctly.  You should not attempt to retry the transaction until first verifying that you have all the coins you started with and that the recipient does not have some of your coins.  You can conveniently do this with an O(n) scan over all Bitcoin transactions ever.  (Someone pointed out to me on twitter that it isn&#x27;t O(n) if you have your database indices set properly.  Well, yeah, true.)<p>You&#x27;ll need to know what addresses you actually sent from, which is obscured by the sentoaddress API described above, for that scan to succeed, so essentially you&#x27;re going to reimpliment much of the Satoshi Bitcoin client, particularly around the area of wallet management.  Don&#x27;t reimpliment everything, though -- down that path lies madness.  Also, try not to make any bugs anywhere, particularly not the kind which only show up when someone tries to steal from you.<p>Good luck!",Twitter
2014-01-27 20:57:53,Why isn't People-Centric UI Design taking off?,"The article brings up a good point, sometimes it makes more sense to start with the person. For example, let&#x27;s say I need to get in touch with my friend to quickly inform them of a change to our plans.<p>Open Skype? Not online. Check Facebook, nope, they&#x27;re not on. Messenger? Nope. Ok, I&#x27;ll open my contact book, and get their number to call.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to simply select the person I&#x27;m trying to reach, and see what platforms they&#x27;re online, so I can choose my contact method?<p>Or what if I want to see what&#x27;s new with one friend? I should be able to click their name, and see their facebook changes, new tweets, status updates, etc.<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t always the case, I might want to open Facebook without plans to browse a particular person, or I might open Skype just to see who&#x27;s online that I can video call.<p>So, there are times when I need to take both routes. They should both be available so I can choose either. It&#x27;s complicated to aggregate content from a variety of sources into a single page, so it&#x27;s not a surprise why this option isn&#x27;t frequently available. You would almost need a new standard, so HN could provide an API for a user&#x27;s comments, posts, etc, and Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc, all do the same. Then I can build an app that merges all of this information together. So a user opens the app, and creates a page for John, enters John&#x27;s Facebook profile, Twitter&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;HN handles, and everything appears in a single place. However, these sources then get less direct traffic, and therefore less revenue, so it&#x27;s unlikely they would jump on-board.",Twitter
2014-01-20 12:44:36,Show HN: Fetch your last tweet (to show on your site) hassle free,"Since Twitter changed their API to require authentication on every request about all the sites I&#x27;ve made got broken. They all had this &quot;Last tweet&quot; bubble that suddenly didn&#x27;t work anymore. Now I fixed it. Instead of changing every site back-end code to contemplate an authenticated request to Twitter&#x27;s API, I made a separate web app that does that and only that. It accepts cross-origin requests and delivers your last tweet in additional formats to fit your need. It even auto link your URLs and mentions. Now I made it public. Hope you enjoy it.",Twitter
2014-01-08 03:14:22,"Hacker News down, unwisely returning HTTP 200 for outage message","Not every webpage is created equally.<p>When we say API, we usually think of it as Twitter API that sort of thing, which we can send a JSON or XML and get back something easily parasable.<p>Sites like HN doesn&#x27;t have that kind of service. Instead, it returns HTML. That&#x27;s fine. No one said API can&#x27;t return HTML.<p>When some part of the Twitter API becomes unavailable, the API server should return 503 when we asks those APIs to return response. If these bad APIs are also used to power some part of the frontend, then the frontend will not work properly. For example, viewing thumbnail from dashboard may be down. But the rest of the page is functioning. In that case, you can&#x27;t send 503 from the frontend. It doesn&#x27;t make sense. So if any crawler reading Twitter.com it shouldn&#x27;t see 503 when it hit the home page.<p>When HN is down, it should return 503. There are two reasons. First, HN is not functional anymore. The page you see may just be a maintenance page configured in Nginx, much like 404 error page. Secondly, HN is itself an API service. When it is broken, it is broken. It just doesn&#x27;t work anymore. When you try to access it through a Python script, it doesn&#x27;t return in the format you expect it to return. When you debug you realize it is not returning anything like you were expecting because most of the HTML structure is gone. This is not an API format change. It&#x27;s simply the backend is not functional anymore.<p>And semantically, when your site is under a maintenance mode, 503 makes sense. 200 is not that evil. It just doesn&#x27;t give anyone a better clue.",Twitter
2013-12-19 13:37:20,How the first PHP functions were named,"I think the latest PHP APIs are the least of your problems if you&#x27;re running sites with code that hasn&#x27;t been touched in 15 years:<p>* new security threats that have been discovered in that time which needed to be coded against (In the last 15 years, a lot has changed with the approach we have to building secure sites).<p>* newer web standards and browsers - thus compatibility on the client side might now be an issue.<p>* different computing paradigms (we use touch interfaces where hover-over menus wouldn&#x27;t function. There&#x27;s a massive range of different client side screen resolutions and aspect ratios these days too).<p>* different methods of sharing content (for some types of sites, supporting OpenGraph and Twitter Cards is pretty important if you depend on your content getting exposure from &quot;word of mouth&quot;).<p>* different user expectations (a 15 year old site is unlikely to look any good compared their modern counterparts. While that might not matter for some sites, if you&#x27;re trying to generate traffic from the average layman, then they might be put off and prefer a site which is more aesthetically pleasing).<p>So if someone is trying to port 15 year old PHP code to a new server, then I&#x27;d expect they&#x27;d want &#x2F; need to do a sizeable amount of rewriting anyway - regardless of API compatibility. In this instance, API compatibility is the least of their worries as you can at least just use the &#x27;find&#x2F;replace&#x27; tool in your text editor to fix renamed APIs, where as fixing the other issues (eg switching from the older method of dropping variables into an SQL string, to the current preferred method of parametrized SQL which negates the risk of SQL injection attacks) will take <i>much</i> longer.",Twitter

2013-11-20 14:39:05,Xbox One: The Review,"I would say that people, and their reasons for objecting to surveillance or having privacy concerns far are more complicated and varied than you are imagining.  Some of the people who have expressed concerns may be:<p>Citizens concerned about government officials overstepping constitutional bounds and lying about it, but not particularly concerned about the practical consequences of the surveillance.<p>Activists for whom NSA surveillance confirms that government  is not on the side of the people, but whose sense of history leads them to the conclusion that if massive FBI files, Jim Crow laws, and lynching did not stop the Civil Rights movement, metadata is unlikely to prevent the arc of history bending towards justice.<p>“Airbus nationalists” in Europe who are, in their heart, more concerned about the fact the EU seems to be incapable of developing a Facebook, Google, Twitter, ect. They may ape the language of their fellow citizens whose privacy concerns are based on Nazi&#x2F;Stasi&#x2F;etc. historical experience, but actually view cloud computing as industrial policy struggle.  Video game manufacture is likely not their strategic priority.<p>People with specific consequentialist privacy concerns.  For example, someone who hates Facebook because it has caused something embarrassing to be shared without their truly informed consent. They may be indifferent to the notion that embarrassing information is hidden on a government database, and they may actually welcome and value that Google algorithms leverage their g-mail and search history to serve up more relevant ads.<p>People who once cared, but are so sick of monomaniacs hijacking every HN discussion that they are looking forward to buying an Xbox One simply as a sign of contempt.

2013-11-17 07:30:39,Dear Googles: G+/YouTube Anschluss – you've done outed me,"A comment I left a few weekends ago, which addressed the same topic but before the Youtube&#x2F;G+ story broke: [0]<p>&quot;Hijacking the top comment to talk about a big concern I have. This EFF article argues that there&#x27;s a place for Anonymity on the Internet [1], and I think most of us agree (especially if we emphathize with those in Iran, China, Syria, and the like).<p>But what HNers must realize is the following: The mainstream Internet <i>can not become</i> the Tor-visited Dark-Net (which restores anonymity) that many believe is inevitable WITHOUT losing its positive sociological impact. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, even HN rely on anonymity and also provide a great deal of such value.  Here&#x27;s a simple example of &#x27;sociological impact&#x27;: CNN (FoxNews, etc) pays attention to what the top links on Reddit are, because the site is in the public&#x27;s face -- and: the people have a collective voice.<p>Next: Without the perception of anonymity, sites like Reddit will stop flourishing.<p>Let&#x27;s go deeper:  Reddit&#x27;s culture thrives on &quot;anonymity&quot; in the form of throwaway accounts and people being themselves without representing themselves.  Throwaway accounts (heard of &#x27;Cation Bot&#x27; or &#x27;AWildSketchAppeared&#x27;?) are a form of expression unique to environments which allow for anonymity (pseudonyms). Who&#x27;s to say novelty accounts would be as risque or hilarious without anonymity?  Certainly these sites flourish because users feel comfortable playing a part and taking a chance.<p>There are two issues at play which threaten anonymity on Reddit. Now obvious (in light of Snowden&#x27;s leaks): 1.) Reddit usernames can, and probably are, being mapped to peoples&#x27; actual identity. ... Not as obvious: 2.) Users&#x27; up and down votes, even private messages, can also be sniffed with ease.<p>Reddit&#x27;s&#x27; devteam has retreated from the idea of providing HTTPS for its voting&#x2F;web API [2], so people&#x27;s actions (aside from comments) can be mapped as well. I tried to raise awareness of this issue five months ago [3].  I know there&#x27;s an argument to be made that SSL&#x2F;HTTPS is useless anyway (just use Tor!, they say), but the bigger question remains:<p>Can a mainstream community such as Reddit exist in tomorrow&#x27;s Internet?  I&#x27;d say that such web-societies are fragile -- likely targets of dragnet surveillance and subversion, especially given their disruptive nature.<p>People and the press are paranoid about Facebook&#x2F;Google privacy because its users (are encouraged to) identify themselves <i>explicitly</i>, but the reality is no different with sites like Reddit - just the perception.

2013-11-05 02:16:18,Ask HN: Anyone want to build an app with me?,"I&#x27;m not sure exactly what you&#x27;re envisioning, but I&#x27;ve been working (on and off) a side project that sounds very similar. The name I have is InfoStream (not Trademarked), and the domain is infostre.am (not currently in use). I will E-mail and tell you more about what I was envisioning in terms of my project, and we&#x27;ll see how it matches up with your vision. If we have a match, maybe we can work on it together (or maybe I can contribute somehow). The problem I came up with was Monetization, specifically on the Twitter Platform. Twitter seems to be the best source of real time information, but when they introduced API 1.1 and the (IMO) extremely gray 1.5 rule (do not replicate the core twitter experience) I placed this project on the back burner. It just does not make sense to dedicate time to a project on a platform that will likely pull the plug [1]. In many ways, the vision I have (InfoStream) is replicating the core Twitter experience. I find Twitter&#x27;s approach towards filtering data (lists) and presenting data to the user (single context feed) to be extremely weak, and ripe for innovation. Yet delivering this information is the core Twitter experience, and thus even though I think I can provide methods to deliver information better (more contextually accurate, more valuable), this is not what Twitter wants. So I end up where lots of other people have ended up; Could build something cool on Twitter, but it&#x27;s just too unstable from a Developers perspective. If you can think of other Sources for real time data that are not as controlling, more trustworthy, and&#x2F;or easier to Monetize, I&#x27;m open to trying a different approach. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think Twitter is a good choice. And I am hoping that an IPO will change things (but I&#x27;m not sure).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130417052642-32720-my-worst-career-mistake-build-in-someone-else-s-garden"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;today&#x2F;post&#x2F;article&#x2F;20130417052642-32...</a>",Twitter

This EFF article argues that there&#x27;s a place for Anonymity on the Internet [2], and I think most of us agree. Especially if we emphathize with those in Iran, China, Syria, and the like.<p>But anonymity is also the key to websites like Reddit and Twitter (including HN).  These websites represent breakthroughs in sociology: memes; open, real-time, transnational,  popular (upvote&#x2F;downvote, retweetable) discourse.<p>It&#x27;s not an understatement to say that Reddit, Twitter, even H.N. are some of the greatest manifestations of the Internet-age -- look at the impact they have had on mainstream media and raising the bar for popular discourse.<p>(Ex.1: I would argue that the Snowden revelations would not have persisted in the public conscious nearly as long if it hadn&#x27;t been for Reddit&#x27;s continued rage. \nEx.2: As it is, news outlets hawk Reddit&#x2F;HN for story-material, and build the story&#x27;s narrative with Twitter.)<p>But what HNers must realize is that: The mainstream Internet __can not become__ the Tor-visited Dark-Net that many believe is inevitable -- WITHOUT losing its positive sociological impact.<p>Yet without the perception of anonymity, sites like Reddit will stop flourishing.<p>Reddit&#x27;s culture thrives on anonymity, throwaway accounts, and people being themselves without representing themselves.<p>There are two issues at play. Now obvious: 1.) Reddit usernames can be mapped to people&#x27;s actual identity. Not as obvious: 2.) Users up and down votes can also be mapped to their identity.  Reddit as a dev-team has retreated from the idea of providing HTTPS for its voting&#x2F;web API, so people&#x27;s actions (aside from comments) can be mapped as well. I tried to raise this point 5 months ago [3]. I know there&#x27;s an argument to be made that SSL&#x2F;HTTPS is useless anyway (just use Tor!, they say), but the bigger question remains:<p>Can a mainstream community like Reddit exist in tomorrow&#x27;s Internet?<p>People and the press are paranoid about Facebook&#x2F;Google privacy because its users identify themselves explicitly, but the reality is no different with sites like Reddit - just the perception.

For example, with their new vector-based system, will Google phase out tiles at some point? There are some apps that might be incompatible with vector-based data, so this could matter. Or more relevantly, will Google restrict API access?

Did Google open source their search engine and let anybody advertise on their site for free while I wasn&#x27;t looking?<p>I really don&#x27;t understand this meme about the web being &#x27;open&#x27;. Much of the native desktop software I use is open source. Practically none of the web services I use are open source. There is not much chance of a &#x27;GNU project&#x27; for the web (i.e. reimplementing an open google and twitter and facebook and so on). Open source web services of significance are few and far between and when it comes to controlling our data usually the best we get is a proprietary API that may or may not get shut down or changed tomorrow.<p>The web gave us RSS which was good[1] but since then it has been pretty much a non stop stream of proprietary APIs and platform lock-in. Even things built on RSS tend to be proprietary APIs rather than open standards: take Google Reader for example. Before it shut down it should have been trivial to pull your subscriptions out of it and point your clients at a new replacement rss-syncing server (like you can do with an email client). But it wasn&#x27;t because there was no damn standard for that, just proprietary APIs as various people wanted to lock you into their cloud service. The standards that have emerged have been, of course, ones that generally involve lock-in to proprietary platforms, like OAuth.<p>[1] interestingly many of the new generation of web developers seem to dislike RSS.",Twitter

2013-09-11 13:23:51,Why cards are the future of the web ,"Well, of course cards are semantically equal to RSS feeds or HTML tags - the card is a presentation concept for the idea of a &quot;container&quot;, after all; programmatically, they can be treated the same as any other information block.<p>What changes is that they&#x27;re now visible to the end user, while their structure previously could only be accessed by the system&#x27;s developer. Now they can be published through an API, or directly manipulated from a GUI; that&#x27;s a change in focus - the same operations can be done on the content, but different people can perform them if they are published as atomic cards instead of embedded in larger, whole documents.<p>Semantic-aware interfaces are less based on applications and more on tasks. These interfaces work just like with the old CLI, where instead of loading data into an app (where available commands are selected and composed by the developer), you have a information flowing through a &quot;pipe&quot; of independent commands selected by the user from all commands available in the system. Environments like KDE Plasma Active [1] (still app-based, but with &quot;Activities&quot; that represent tasks), or the old Cannon Cat and its spiritual succesor Archy (which was a graphical version of Emacs, sort of) [2], are examples of this model of interaction. These are not new concepts, really, but they&#x27;ve never been fully realized in graphical interface (afaik only the Canon Cat and Emacs follow them, and both are text-based).<p>Yes, Google Reader is a good example of the kind of content aggregation and sharing that I&#x27;m pursuing with my ideal system (and many people found it useful, so there&#x27;s an 	
audience for it). Google Now is another system which has chosen the card metaphor to show information according to context. But Reader was not programmable, as it had fixed styling that couldn&#x27;t be changed by the end-user; and Google Now has fixed rules created by the provider, not the user. I believe that the card is a natural data structure for people that don&#x27;t have a programming background to create simple procedures, that would allow users to create new behaviors for these tools.<p>You&#x27;ve given me some thoughts to chew with the &quot;more confusing than twitter, less powerful than raw data&quot;; I&#x27;m certainly aiming for &quot;more powerful than twitter&quot;, and I&#x27;ll have to ponder how to achieve that without making it too confusing.

2012-09-06 13:05:15,Show HN: Diligu: Our microblogging music-discovery site,"Hey Diligu friends - Great job launching something especially in the music business space.<p>Some feedback:<p>1. The head line ""we f*cking love music"" is not about me the user it's about you the company.  While it's nice to know it doesn't tell anything about the website.<p>2. Some spacing between the picture, the ""Want to ..."" and the list of songs would help give the elements some breathing room.<p>3. On the top bar on the front page you have ""Start"", ""Join Today"" and ""Sign In"".  The ""Start"" link just takes me back to the front page.  This was confusing as I thought that ""Start"" and ""Join Today"" were actually the same thing.<p>4. I like the idea though dislike the people you are going to charge.  Minor artists rarely have extra funds to through around on marketing that is not directly tied to concerts, t-shirts, stickers, etc.  Here you are asking minor artists to pay for people they want to reach without actually (at least where I could see) trying to convince me as a minor artist that a) you have enough people for me to care, b) that they are worth paying, and c) that they really are worth 10 cents per user.<p>5. Outside of the three free songs on the front page - it's not clear to me that is has anything to do with microblogging or music-discovery or that as an artist that I can buy audiences.<p>6. If it is a microblogging website, I'd love to browse users or artists without having to sign up/in with twitter and/or facebook.<p>7. Using uservoice - i'm not always a fan of this because I clicked on it and all I saw were problems that people had with your service that I hadn't even thought about.  Note - this isn't to say that you should hide the problems.<p>8. In the footer you link to API and then when I click into it you tell me that you don't have anything ready and that I should contact you to tell you what I want.  Perhaps it's better to not say anything until you actually have it?  Otherwise it really raises expectations and makes the product feel incomplete.<p>9. In the footer you also have twitter (blog).  For me these are two very different things so I was surprised that they went to the same place.  In a similar point to the API, if you don't have a blog, that's cool - just don't put it so that expectations are kept on the right things.<p>10. If you are going to sell audiences, are you going to provide some money back to users?<p>11. I tried to sign up using twitter.  What you want to do with my twitter account is pretty crazy - especially ""Update your profile.""  There is no way that I would ever sign up for a service has the ability to change my twitter profile.  Also, tweeting out for me is my boundary line.  Also somewhat shocking is following new people for me.  Perhaps I haven't been using all the new music startups, but for a website that i'm supposed to be using to discover new music, these seem like pretty harsh consequences for signing up.<p>12. So I signed up/in anyway to give feedback.  Once I sign up you then ask me to come up with a user name.  Couldn't you have used my twitter account?  This extra step doesn't add anything to your service (haven't seen what this user account will be used for or what it means) so it's just another step that would make me want to close the browser.<p>13. I selected a genre ""indie"" and then couldn't figure out how to move to the next steps.  I finally realized after clicking on a ton of stuff that I had to click on something that looks like a pasta shell.  When I hover over it the eye opens and it says follow.  This is really hard to understand and doesn't tell me what to do.<p>14. If I click on indie / electro / pop user ""Peng"" is at the top of the list for all of them.  If I click sequentially, I don't actually see the list of people change so it makes it look like these are the only people that I'll be able to follow.  perhaps make this random so at least it makes it look like there's all type of users.<p>15. I'm not entirely sure why I want to follow people or how it will make my life awesome.  Most of the text talks about Diligu not why following people will make my life awesome.<p>16. I followed user ""peng"", then I go to step two and you ask for more credentials to more services?  Here is where I stopped.  This is way too hard and way too many steps to jump through before I can even start enjoying the service.<p>17. I skipped the rest of the steps and the first thing I see when I finally get in is a huge ad telling me to give you my facebook credentials so that it can find new friends for me.  So far i've spend like 10 minutes trying to get into the website and no value has been provided to me yet.<p>I like the idea of a twitter where the followers I can follow are based exclusively on their musical tastes.  However, I think you have to rethink your onboarding process and how to add value to the user right off of the bat.<p>Good luck and keep us updated!",Twitter
2012-09-06 11:37:50,"New Twitter API Drops Support for RSS, Puts Limits on Third-Party Clients","Edit: I stand corrected. Apparently, a lot of people do use RSS twitter for various reasons. Presumably the resyndication clause is targeted to prevent people re-creating RSS feeds that they are using from the API, though I have no idea why.<p>I'm not one of the RSS doom-predictors, as I find it very useful to keep up to date with blogs/etc that don't update very often and aren't enough on my radar to check frequently. Saying that, who on earth was using RSS to keep track of twitter? I can't imagine it was at all efficient, or easier than the API.<p>The other change that seems to be listed here:<p>&#62; <i>Dont resyndicate data. If your service consumes Twitter data, dont take that data and expose it via an API, post it to other cloud services, and so on.</i><p>has several possible conclusions listed, which I don't think are warranted. This looks like it's to squash any possibility of people getting around the  user client limit by aggregating updates, before it happens.

2012-08-27 21:43:56,Where did the Tweetbot for Mac Alpha go?,"&#62; If the app wishes to not show ads or to use twitter for more of an ""infrastructure-like"" purpose, then there should be some kind of use-fee-based pricing model on the API side.<p>No need for this complexity. They could just revoke API access for apps that don't show ads per their guidelines. It'd be easy to catch any Twitter client with a significant user base that isn't showing ads properly.<p>At the end of the day though solutions like this just aren't realistic. If Twitter's going to show ads and other content like cards in their stream, advertisers have to have confidence that the content and presentation will be preserved. The only way to truly do this effectively is to control how your product is presented in all cases.<p>The problem isn't that Twitter's making these changes. The problem is that Twitter's only getting around to doing this now, years after a vibrant ecosystem of third-party clients has been well established. No one complains that there isn't a rich market for third-party Facebook clients, even though the Facebook app historically has been pretty substandard. Facebook, wisely, never relinquished control over their platform.<p>Twitter, as ever, is cleaning up for previous incompetence, trying to clean up a mess that never should have existed. How could they not have assigned one or two people to build an iPhone client the minute the iPhone SDK was announced in 2008? How blind do you have to be to not anticipate that mobile will be huge for Twitter, a service originally engineered around being used over SMS?<p>Watching Twitter bungle issue after issue over the years gives the distinct impression that Twitter is successful in spite of their executive management, not because of it.",Twitter

2012-08-17 05:00:30,Interpreting some of Twitters API changes,"Question: is there anything stopping an app from using an invisible embedded web view to pull content from Twitter, mimicking a plain browser, and then scraping the content from the DOM as a poor man's API?<p>It would be tedious as hell, especially now that Twitter is all-Ajax-all-the-time, and it would be a moving target as they made changes, but could Twitter really do anything to stop it?",Twitter
2012-07-27 21:49:33,On building an API rating agency,"If you aren't paying for the product, you are the product. It is true. But now, so many applications are based on these monopolistic API, which can change terms and conditions and pricing at any time. More than 1 000 000 3rd party apps for twitter, even Google maps changed pricing recently. It is about charging money, but also about policy and involvment to developers, viable business model and company's roadmap. But without any ""rating"" how would you manage your cloud supply chain with thousand of APIs?",Twitter
2012-07-25 12:02:18,So you want to offer a public API ,"Interesting article. I wasn't aware of services like 3scale. Anyone got any experience of using them?<p>I developed, and am responsible for, a moderately complex b2b web API that is been in use for about three years. A b2b API embodies a contract between organisations, and it's important to understand that this is different to b2c (e.g. Twitter) which is less restrictive.<p>The biggest issue for me has been dealing with change. User requirements change. The underlying system changes and accretes new features that need to be exposed in the API. How to deal with this without either compromising the integrity of the API's design or (at the other extreme) breaking systems that use the API, is not easy. I don't know of any easy answers, but design your URLs and data schemas with versioning in mind and get to know the developers who use your API.<p>Documentation is very important. If your API exposes complex data then make sure that you have good documentation on what every data element means.",Twitter
2012-07-20 08:30:35,Fred Wilson is wrong about Free,"I think it's a great idea that will fail in this implementation.<p>The first barrier in social networks is people - getting enough people on your network to incentivize others to follow. Is the fact that app.net paid enough to draw people away from Twitter &#38; Facebook? As a developer, perhaps, but as a user, I really doubt it.<p>A much better sales pitch would be just ""you own your data"". Give users amazing import/export tools from the get go. Allow third parties to fork your system and allow seamless user migration. Build a protocol, not a service.<p>With a business hat on, I also worry about the single silo of data in app.net. Say it does become successful, then they're a monopoly again. How can we be sure they'll fairly charge for their API usage when they realise how much it costs to hosts that much real time data? Can we be sure they won't change the playing field again?<p>Besides all that, I don't get why he wants $500,000 up front. If he wants to ""align our financial incentives with members &#38; developers"", I would have thought he'd charge a set fee to allow revenue to scale with usage.<p>Also the language on the site is just so damn confusing. They have lots of ideas jammed in together. Most of the discussion about the idea has been people trying to figure out what they're on about. They need to figure out a sales pitch people can understand and stick to it.<p>Anyway, lots of huge holes in this implementation IMO. I doubt it'll even get funded.",Twitter

2012-06-30 20:14:07,Twitter Continues to Restrict Access to Our Tweets,"As a developer I too a, disappointed by Twitter's move to restrict API access as it has but again, still as a developer, I can understand Twitter's point of view and I'll actually say what they're doing is smart and other sites should follow suit.<p>We all want our API access, we want it now, we want it free, and we want it unrestricted whether we monetize our use of another app's API or not. But unfortunately we can't just feed off Twitter's teet and expect them to just cater to our every want. API access is a privilege, not a right. By monetizing their API as they are they are avoiding the most common mistake that afflicts tech startups - the problem of monetization. They have their ""verified"" accounts and ""promoted tweets"" which is a good start and now that the API has become so valuable they are monetizing this. They're a company that offers a free service and making a true profit instead of just taking on VC money and hoping someone will figure out how they'll make money later. They did this at just the right time too. They are now an established player much like Facebook. Now that users are locked in and so many people are getting value from Twitter's quick information sharing and marketing capabilities they made a smart decision with this new monetization strategy.<p>We all should have known the free ride would end eventually. In many cases, apps using the API are actually competing with twitter itself! Surely you can't expect Twitter to allow competing apps like iOS and Android apps to outshine them. So these restrictions force those competing clients to actually innovate still! Yes, access to tweets are limited but apps like Hootsuite and others have found ways to use the API in other ways like scheduling tweets.<p>I'll definitely concede that I think their limits are a bit strict and they are pretty much only useful for hobby projects. At the same time, though, we've become spoiled and entitled and I can definitely understand the restrictions. Reactions to policies like this are to be expected. Everyone always throws a fit when these things happen but we'll live and we have to understand that Twitter needs money to run so they can provide an API at all and if we want to make a buck off Twitter's API we can't expect a free ride. That's like asking the owner of an office building to let you use office space free because... Well... It's there. That said, they need to be smart about this too. Too much restriction will hurt them but too little will mean they aren't generating what they need. But right now I don't think we can judge whether these policies are really that bad because, like I said, any time a service makes these changes everyone starts complaining and a lot of exaggeration goes on.",Twitter
2012-06-30 18:26:21,"Has the notion of ""files"" outlived its usefulness?","Web APIs change on the whim of the provider and have no permanent basis to build on. No one benefits from pretending that web APIs are as stable, composable, or as powerful as <i>proper</i> files.<p>I italicized proper there because my real point is that you're simply defining yourself the win with the word ""proper"" and not comparing like to like. You can win any comparison by accounting for only the good of one proposition and only the bad of the other, but that's not a valid argument. If, for instance, we ask our web API to have some sort of assurance that it'll be there next year... hell, next <i>week</i>... suddenly ""proper web API"" turns out to resolve to absolutely no concrete noun at all.

It was interesting, because it ended up all being a bit of a precursor to the Arab Spring and many current events in the middle east today.<p>I loved doing it. The API team was responsive, and although we were never able to get full Firehose (despite offerring large amount of money) we were able to easily play with and access a lot of data.<p>Much/all of that has changed. The API has gotten really complex to work with. The terms of service are no longer friendly. Getting whitelisted accounts for standard API calls is impossible, and overall feeling like we have any influence or use to Twitter is dwindling.<p>Whereas at one point I felt it was a joy to work with, now I feel its impossible. Getting the data to study is impossible (or expensive, since a few companies control the firehose), and there's the constant feeling of getting shut down at any moment. Plus, there's just too much data to grab given the clunky methods you have to use to do it. I'd kill for a hard drive of the 'network graph' with diffs over time. As-is, its impossible to answer certain academic questions.<p>To a certain degree, while Twitter is used far more now than in 2009, it feels boring, obvious and less important to me.

2012-05-02 13:59:42,Simplicity Matters By Rich Hickey (Keynote at RailsConf 2012),"With web services, documents are your public API.  Once a service is public, there is a contract between you and the consumers of the API that it will not change until a new version comes out.  This is why we see the /v1/ convention in REST services.  /v1/ MUST not change on people.  You wouldn't do that with a public C library, you shouldn't do that with web services. It is anti-social to change that API on developers.<p>These documents are very complex. Just take a look at a twitter timeline JSON response.  Having a getter and setter for every field in that document would get ridiculous.<p>The problem with JSON is it is so easy to change that it takes self discipline to enforce your own social contract.  We all know that when faced with deadlines some developers get a little fast and loose to meet that deadline.",Twitter

Twitter and Facebook offer access to their feeds via their API, which you can only use when you agree to their terms of service.

OP brings up a good point that using only GET/PUT/POST/DELETE to only represent CRUD is extremely limiting, but suggests that using even more obscure HTTP methods would be less limiting? I would argue not only is it limiting, it is also obscure, what is it about ""PUT"" that implies update vs. create?<p>If you look at the twitter API (<a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api</a>) (commonly held up as exemplary REST) you will see exactly 2 methods, GET and POST.

2012-07-27 21:49:39,Dave Winer: An open Twitter-like ecosystem,"hm, don't be so sure. I was of your opinion and recently changed that when learnt about Instagram success.<p>It seems like internet is still a very young thing and people jump the ship or move on to a new thing very often, without much sentiment, like a child on a playground going from one toy to another.<p>Twitter introduced photos sharing long time ago, but it didn't stop guys from Insta to literally rip it off (adding ""follows"" and similar features). Where one thought ""well I cannot build photo sharing service because the giant in the room (twitter) just introduced it"" -- the others just continued pushing the code and eventually exit for $1B.<p>I think at some point users will move on from Facebook like they did from MySpace. MySpace biggest problem was javascript, audio and graphical clutter that rape you fresh out of the screen once the page finished loading. So others (hello Facebook) took advantage of it and come up with similar page but this time nice fresh and cleancut. So let's move further and ask ourselves a question: what is the biggest Facebook problem? I believe right now it is overclutter with irrelevant info served from your network. Having more than 100 ""friends"" makes your wall so clutter than no information is of value anymore.<p>So you want to come up with Facebook killer? no problem -- just build a system (whether mechanical or manual) where users can take real advantage out of their network, not miss important update from important friends and miss the unnecessary garbage they are not interested in. Don't be fooled by ""oh they wont come because they did all this work building up their facebook profiles"". Not only there is FB Api that you can connect to and download all FB user data in minutes, but if FB would close that gate, you can still program a info scrapper that would do so.<p>Bottom line: Facebook won't be here forever, and next stage of social is million connected friends but only relevant info rendered.",Twitter

2012-07-12 15:15:29,"Thoughts on Rails, Node, and the web apps of today","I heard the first call for ""Rails is dead"" around 7-8 months ago. While then I completely disregarded it, now I'm even more so disregarding it.<p>I choose the right tool for the right task. Linger on that over-used saying for a moment.<p>I use Rails when I'm not familiar with the domain enough (this is the business of Software Engineering, we never are as familiar with the domain as the domain experts) and it provides me a platform for radically fast development, in the end I may also have a product that can withhold 2-3 years of evolution, before we need to scale, if even needed (premature optimization..).<p>I also use Rails when the quality levels are set high, and when I need tons of libraries, and I need those fast. In node, the quality level of such libraries are much worse (if you haven't seen it, you're not doing Node enough time - because I haven't seen it at my first half a year on Node). The number of quality libraries / npm modules are probably several magnitudes of order less than that of Ruby gem world. You're going to need to wait 4 years until you get that level of diversity and quality and it sets up in a comparable way.<p>And I use Ruby when I don't care about slow clients, or doing system-level work.<p>At any given time, I keep myself the option to use JRuby, which has comparable to MRI (the ""normal"", C implementation of Ruby) performance and better on a considerable number of criteria. IMHO DynamicInvoke on the JVM will be a game changer in terms of people considering JRuby against, Groovy, or Scala.<p>I use node.js when I know the domain will remain small, non-complex, and I'll be dealing with slow clients (real users).<p>To top all of that, backend systems will NOT turn into thin api servers. Not by any chance. Twitter themselves are rolling back their SPA and bringing back server side template rendering. The number of problem you get into while moving all of your logic and rendering to the client requires a huge blog post which I'll probably make one day. Most people are not aware of that because they never came from full-fledged enterprise level desktop apps -- I used to design CADs and pretty familiar with complex client-side architectures, there are so many dragons there, I'm very happy I now live on the server side, where things are much more predictable.<p>So no, Rails is not dying and neither is Ruby. With the advent of progress on the JVM and JRuby they never will -- this whole discussion reminds me of ""Java is about to die"" when Scala came around and ""Java is about to die"" when Oracle came around. And guess what - it didn't (go read about Java 8).<p>tldr; I use both, and I'd recommend anyone would, too. Server-side will never be just a thin api, Ruby or Rails will not die (at least not by that sword), and the only thing one might want to work on is a good foundation of intuition of when to use which of those.<p>@jondot",Twitter

2012-03-26 17:11:32,Using Objective-C On The Server,"A few months ago I was making plans for what is now my home base website for App Store &#38; other projects. I'd been working in obj-c for about 2 years both on the Mac and on iOS, but also had a fair bit of python experience with Django, App Engine, etc. I decided to give it a shot with obj-c.<p>I knew about the handful of ""big"" frameworks for handling this task with obj-c, but rejected them in favor of getting more hands-on experience building it, pushing myself and learning in the process. It was, of course, a personal project, something I alone was responsible for working with, so I decided it was OK if I experimented a little.<p>I went into the project knowing I would eventually have to port it to Python (and I did), but it was a lot of fun :)<p>I hand picked some lightweight libraries to handle specific parts of the server. One has to be cautious knowing that a library developer who thinks their sole target is a tiny cellphone, may not be worrying about things you will eventually have to worry about on a server.<p>I picked CocoaHTTPServer to handle requests and responses, and someone else had written a nicer ""route"" style interface for it which meant all of the possible responses to an http request were simply a series of blocks defined in a row, each with a regex or named parameter style URL route defined right there next to the code that would handle it. This works out to be quite a similar layout in code as something like Bottle/Python or Express/Node.js, both of which I've worked with now and I very much prefer this style.<p>I made good use of blocks &#38; dispatch queues elsewhere as well, firing off an async block whenever I needed to pull new tweets from Twitter's api, or update Github repo stats (both are cached and displayed on the site).<p>I picked a Mustache template library and a Markdown parser library I found on Github for handling dynamic page generation &#38; blog post syntax, respectively. Sqlite for storing anything that needed to be stored, Regexkit-lite for properly checking and handling anything that may be passed in to a url query or post body, etc.<p>I changed the Xcode project type to build me an executable binary that lived inside a bundle (Server.bundle) containing all the pages and assets the thing needed, so it could be deployed as a single ""thing"".<p>I also got Lion's sandboxing to work quite easily, which in theory would give some moderate protection against the entire server being compromised if someone managed to get an exploit to run inside the process.<p>Other than some CPU usage issues with the template library (easily solved by nginx caching pages), it all worked really, really well. I threw enough abuse at it, and did enough debugging that I was confident it would hold up well in production (which turned out to be wrong).<p>And then it came time to deploy somewhere, a problem I had been working on since day one, so i knew what i was getting in to.<p>There were only a few options: a cross-compiler framework like Cocotron (compile on Mac, run on Linux), one of the native *step libraries like GNUstep running on Linux or FreeBSD, or simply deploy on a Mac somewhere.<p>I tried all combinations other than Mac first, I built out a GNUstep environment with libobjc2 on FreeBSD, tried the cocotron-&#62;linux stuff, each time watching something blow up in my face due to my choice of components and my requirements.<p>While obj-c is cross platform, some of the libraries and features I chose to use were not. CocoaHTTPServer is built on top of CFNetwork, which is not part of any obj-c framework/library, but rather a lower level Apple C library only found on Macs. There's a ""lite"" open source version, but I quickly discovered that solving one issue like that would only bring up another. For instance, dispatch blocks will only work with GNUstep at the moment, and only when it is compiled with clang, against libobjc2, a combination few if any Linux distros actually ship in their repos.<p>Not a lot of people interested in deploying modern, dispatch/block-heavy, obj-c 2.0 code to Linux, not nearly as many as there are deploying such things to OS X or iOS.<p>So I decided why not just run on a Mac server somewhere? After all I can't solve every problem all at the same time, and on a Mac a lot of those problems were non-existent, plus the Mac approach would allow me to use things only available on a Mac, like easy sandboxing and potentially keychain integration for auth.<p>I found a Mac VPS provider that ran Xserves and hosted copies of Lion server inside VMware (HostMyApple, not someone fudging the licensing in moms basement). It worked really, really well, as long as I treated it like a headless server (issues with Lion Server are another story for another time). My sandboxing worked, performance was fantastic aside from the CPU usage during a cache miss, so I was fairly happy.<p>Long story short though, memory leaks in 3rd party libraries (that only someone running a server would likely hit), coupled with higher hosting costs (and fewer choices), smaller community and a desire to use some things that are really only ""mature"" in other languages (database adapters, etc), caused me to spend a few days porting the entire thing to Python.<p>My site now runs on a Linode, and is a nearly identical clone of the obj-c version, ported as a Python/Bottle app. There was nothing particularly wrong with the obj-c approach, but the primary focus of nearly all obj-c developers and libraries is iOS, where processes never live longer than a few minutes, or Mac where a crash or leak is only going to affect one person rather than a few hundred in-flight requests. I expect if I had stuck with one of the ""frameworks"" intended for this purpose it would have been a viable option but as I said before I wasn't looking for turn-key, but wanting to get my hands dirty :)",Twitter

2011-12-27 03:27:38,The Facebook Platform Is A Trainwreck,"Twitter?<p>I'm working on Facebook and Twitter and the latter just seems generally nastier (ill documented, ambiguous, not based on a simple graph...). A lot of Facebook the Facebook API is pretty good - well documented, clear and simple. And however bad Oauth 2.0 might be, Oauth 1.1 is worse. Oauth 1.1 is pathologically irrational.<p>And Facebook is only, ONLY directly responsible for THE API ITSELF. If they've maintained some Java or Python stuff, that's right nice of them but it's not their main job. If you are complaining about particular SDKs offered by Facebook, you aren't complaining about ""The Facebook Platform"", you're just complaining. When they change the interface (as they've done several times), then complain.<p>I think the site's motto probably explains things better ""Of course it sucks, it's made of software"".",Twitter

This unique plugin is authorized to request keys for messages for your Trusted Contacts and generate new keys associated with your account.<p>The keys are generated in parallel on the client and on the key management server. They are always rolling forward and are synced in real-time with some unique variables within your custom plugin.<p>No two messages are encrypted with the same key and are only stored in memory during the encryption / decryption process. Every time a message or photo that has been protected is viewed by yourself or others authorization to that messages key is requested.<p>Your Trusted Contact list is managed globally by connecting with other users through Social Fortress. Within Facebook all of your friends are initially treated as Trusted Contacts and you can easily remove individuals from this list with the click of a button.<p>Social Fortress uses AES-256 CTR for the encryption and communicates over a 256 SSL stream from your device to the key management server. The data in this stream is also encrypted using aspects of your customized installation.<p>The technology for web services (Facebook, Google+) operates as browser plugin for Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer (not publicly available right now) and independent of any service's API.<p>The technology for Thunderbird and Outlook is a separate plugin which requires installation.<p>We integrate transparently into the products we support so the user experience is exactly the same. No extra clicks, no confusing decisions and nothing extra to learn. We designed Social Fortress to be used by individuals who don't even know what the word encryption is.<p>Within every environment you have the ability to enable / disable Social Fortress protection with the click of a button or using a keyboard shortcut (CTRL+Q). This only disables the encryption functions. The reader is always on so you can use Social Fortress just to view your friends protected content without having to protect your own. It's like having Flash or PDF Reader once it is installed you don't ever have to do anything again.<p>If your device becomes compromised / lost / whatever you can login to the site and disable all active installations in two clicks and this will not affect previously encrypted messages and we just disable authorization access to your old plugins and have no need to change any previously generated keys.<p>We also support other services but have yet to make them live:<p>Skype Chat, Twitter, mail.yahoo.com, Gmail.com, Chatter.com, Yammer.com, Blackberry Native Email support",Twitter
2011-07-21 01:57:15,Ask HN: Movie/film post-production tool - thoughts on the Landing/Beta page?,"Not bad. The app looks great and your page copy is very effectively targeted. However, there isn't enough of it. when I click one of the items in the cycling list of features, then I expect a new page or a significant amount of extra detail 'below the fold' - not a stock photo with a one-line explanation of a concept that is already self-explanatory to anyone working in the industry.<p>there are other features that I want that I don't see, which are increasingly important to ADs. These are not as critical as the 5 primaries identified already, but which in my view are essential for buy-in. If they're absent or not planned for, then a competitor is going to be able to add duplicate your existing features with little difficulty, add others not available here, and generally leverage their brand to drink your milkshake. The first-mover advantage is very slim, especially in a cutthroat business staffed by technological conservatives who are used to overpaying because they're spending OPM. If an existing provider goes mobile within the next 1-2 years (and they will) their install base will swamp yours. Delays to market will be explained away as 'making sure the product is really ready'.<p>So what are those missing features?<p>o screenwriting software integration - Final Draft at a minimum, also Adobe Story and other competitors. FD can generate breakdown lists, and being able to import these will reduce the work needed for breakdown by 80-90%.<p>o screenplay/breakdown versioning - on large projects, changes in shooting order or rewritten scenes are the norm. Assume they will occur and make sure the process of 'forking' is as easy as possible.<p>o Storyboards. I can't believe you don't have 2-way integration of location scouting and breakdown with mobile cameras.<p>o export to media/printing - in a remote location, you cannot safely assume access to the internet, cloud, or universal availability of smartphones or internet-capable devices among the cast and crew. You will still need to be able to produce sides and fall back on more primitive methods. On long nights in the middle of nowhere with terrible weather, paper, pencil and flashlight are going to be around for a while yet. When it comes to charging electronic devices, cameras and sound recorders are going to take priority over ipads and cellphones.<p>o allow for retroactive changes to be made under the cirucmstances described above; sometimes a weary crew will come back to base camp with a list of necessary changes that are handed to a confused production manager, and which must be entered correctly for the following days' shooting schedule to work.<p>o contact management - naturally you want to have that information centralized, but nobody likes having to enter everybody's contact details into a yet another database program with yet another set of misspellings, incorrect phone numbers, yadda yadda. Allow contact import from GMail, Facebook, google+ hotmail, and other major providers. Allow the creation of a contact address that automatically harvests email information and builds the mailing list. Provide call sheets that include hyperlinks and/or graphical maps leveraging some popular mapping API. Use email, Twilio, Twitter, checkin and location services to automagically alert and monitor call times, navigation planning, ride-sharing, and general logistics.<p>o Ensure that the logistical functionality also applies to location/prop management, gear rental, suppliers and so forth.<p>o Include templates for model, location and service releases and allow for digital signature and post-production hard-copy transmission to reduce presale clearance issues. Releases matter, but to so few people on set that they are frequently overlooked during production, leading to expensive headaches later. The closer to sale or release, the more expensive the headache.<p>o Pre/post breakdowns - breakdowns are such a hassle that they are often prepared only for production, while project management before and after principal photography is often done on the back of an envelope. Get pro with this from the outset. Which also means...<p>o input for shooting logs from the AC/Sound team<p>o digital slating - again, this should be out front - scene/shot # and shot clock on an iPad or Android tablet are a no-brainer, and a key visual sell for your branding. A major missed opportunity in your existing design.<p>o Not to mention GPS on mobile devices. Don't just do an electronic implementation of what's already on paper or a laptop and then make people manually add information from digital sensors.<p>o Hell, start planning now for being an input vector for video/audio recording. I have posted audio that was recorded on an iPod because the director suddenly got inspired while he was having coffee with one of the actors and had the means of production in his pocket.<p>o Platform agnosticism - although Apple dominates in the film world, it is by no means universal. Don't confine yourself to a single platform, especially when 95% of your functionality can be achieved with html, css, and node.js.<p>o Build marketing in from the getgo. Eastwood should also be the tool of choice for image tagging tagging, media assets, managing a social media, and driving your marketing campaign from pre-production onwards using the most enthusiastic and committed members of your team - your cast and crew, who stand to benefit directly from the film's success. You'll also need to coordinate their availability for post-production, sales, and release phases, from wrap parties to reshoots to private screenings.<p>o I'm not 100% sure about your branding; the name 'Eastwood' is very clever but might be misinterpreted as implying the authorship or endorsement of a certain Famous Actor...who has more money, fans, and legal experience than your whole team put together. If I were your lawyer, which I am not and which I could not be because I am not a lawyer, then I would advise against infringing on Clint Eastwood's right of publicity because that would basically require you to give him a Large Amount of Money or ownership of the company in lieu.

A client that spams people's Twitter streams without asking? Obviously not
    ok, loss of API token.

    2. A client that alters people's stream to include affiliate links? Presumably
    not ok, loss of API token? (Questionable)

    3. A client which ""enhances"" people's stream by making semantic clarifications
    to content? Example: Imagine if http://twitter.com/english50cent could be
    programmatically generated from @50cent. Is this not ok? It's certainly
    innovative. What are the consequences? Where is the line?

    4. A client that displays the Twitter stream verbatim but comes up with a new
    visualization? Sounds like this is not ok too, since it might ""confuse""
    consumers? Do you lose your API token for this?

    5. Generally, someone builds something that Twitter didn't think of and gains
    mainstream usage, what is the consequence? What is the risk of Twitter making a
    policy against it and shutting it down due to inconvenience to them?

I waited almost a year longer than expected to get my unit. Because I just wanted to tinker I wasn't bothered. Ninja Blocks say their units are manufactured, just waiting for the enclosures. This might not be a problem for them.<p>-- Battery eaters --
Twine eats batteries like nobodies business. Two AA batteries last about two weeks. On the forums this seems like the typical experience. Ninja Blocks looks as if the central 'Ninja Block' can be mains powered. But will the wireless sensors have a short battery life?<p>-- Web app --
Twine has a website that the device must communicate with to report data and push rules to it. There's no (out-of-the-box) way to get it to talk to a local server via a clean API.<p>This was a big disappointment for me mainly because their web app is very limited:
- No data logging (just reports the latest figure)
- Rules can just be triggered over thresholds (ie when temperature reaches 20c then X) not when temperature changes
- For moisture the actual resistance isn't reported, just a wet or dry condition. This renders it useless for plant watering.<p>Twine can make a HTTP request when a rule is tripped. I plan to play with this but it's not that useful if it can't just HTTP request every time a value changes as I wanted to log temperature (plus it's a GET!).<p>The Ninja Blocks apps look better and appear to fill the gap between reading something then doing something. Twine can really only report something (twitter/sms/email/HTTP supported). But I'd caution that until you get your hands a device like this you don't know of its true limitations.<p>-- Sensors --
I didn't up my kickstarter amount when they announced new sensors. I wish I had, as only the temperature sensor is nearly useful. The other built in sensor is orientation... ? IMHO they should've thrown in the other sensors and maybe upped the price to increase satisfaction.<p>I prefer the sensor pack that ships by default with Ninja Blocks.<p>In spite of the above I'm optimistic about Twine as it really is early days. This space has massive potential if it can break out of communities like ours into the mainstream. I just hope Supermechanical doesn't get distracted and focusses squarely on their flagship product.<p>Ninja Blocks? I won't be ordering but will keep a close eye on what those who receive the first units think. Their approach so far seems to be a better path to market than Twine's crowdfunding and their presentation superior.",Twitter

People bent over backwards to comply. I couldn't make it work, but assumed I was just far behind the curve. A few years later and that roar is gone. Bootstrap.css for everything, with class names that describe structure. I can't say I'm hurt by this as it is what I had resorted to all along.

I also had my own server colo'd for a while, which I do not recommend for a one man shop. It nearly broke me a few times having a server go down and spending all day trying to fix it. I had a sever go down hard 2 days before I got married, but I had to let it go until 2 days after the wedding. I didn't think the site would recover from that.<p>The hardest part was to scale it economically. I have always been a big fan of SSD's, which are instrumental in scaling a site that doesn't have the resources to put data they need fast access to in RAM. For example, a site with more money might use redis to cache all the pics for each user (sorted, unique lists), plus all the tweets that point to a pic, but there is too much for me to do that in RAM without selling organs. Also, redis is not very memory efficient. But the advantage is that technologies like that are easy to use and easy to scale. If you have money.<p>The Twitter rule changes freak me out every day but I have not seen any specific moves that make me think they are after me. It is probably a matter of time, but then you need to think about what form that will take. Will they just cut off the Streaming API? That would be a big move. Will they remove pics from the streaming API? I doubt it. Will they make moves to single me out? That would be weird. Will they come after me with lawyers for caching tweets? I don't see that either.

* `JS: Here's an informal message` _(non-error message)_<p>Where STATE is one of `UP`, `DOWN`, `ISSUE`<p>Messages with a state are displayed in the lower portion of the page idefinitely, `ISSUE` or `DOWN` messages will change the icon of the corresponding service.

2012-11-17 23:13:19,Twitter's descent into the extractive,"The issue is one of lock-in.  I think that we here on HN are a reasonable bunch.  It's why I like this community.  We don't begrudge our local pizza place earning profit off of us for providing us with a service.  Similarly, we don't mind people in our own industry earning profit in exchange for a service.<p>However, when a business involves network effects, the morality changes.  If WordPress.com started charging exorbitant fees, cutting off functionality, or putting annoying ads everywhere, I could simply move my blog to any number of other hosts or self-host it and none of my readers would be any the wiser.  However, Twitter grew because it offered this liberal, API-driven architecture that allowed tools to flourish and whatnot.  Now, we're feeling like we're in a bait-and-switch moment and we can't leave because our followers have followed us on Twitter.  If we left, we could no longer connect with them.  We're stuck and unless Twitter does something so crappy that we're willing to start over, we have to live with it.<p>Heck, if Twitter was like this from the beginning, would a competitor have gotten the growth that we gave Twitter?  Let's say that Twitter and Jaiku committed to a 15-year feature set as part of a community promise in 2006.  Twitter told us as users and prospective users (before we built large follower networks) that they were going to shut down third party access and plaster ads over the feeds while Jaiku told us that they would commit to ensuring third party access, but might run ads.  Would we have looked at Twitter and Jaiku and given Jaiku the growth and network?<p>I know it's unreasonable to ask a company to commit to a 15 year feature set.  I'm not suggesting that we have any rights to force Twitter to act how we deem proper.  However, when a company creates a lock-in system (like Twitter does with followers) and they perform a bait-and-switch, I think we do have the right to be mildly annoyed and to point out that this might not be the most moral way of acting.<p>Lock-in allows companies to act against their users in a way we should be against.  That doesn't mean we're against profit.  For example, there was a pizza place near me that offered a large cheese pizza for $5.  It wasn't especially good pizza, but it was $5 and my roommate and I loved it for that.  Later, they raised the price to $7.80 (IIRC).  I assume it wasn't so profitable at $5.  However, at nearly $8, we felt we'd rather pay an additional couple dollars to get better pizza.  We didn't begrudge the store their price hike.  We didn't feel they owed us cheap pizza.  Why?  Because they held no power over us.  We could re-make our decision as things changed.<p>For those of us using Twitter, we can't re-make that decision.  Twitter got some of us to use their service because of things they're now taking away.  Maybe other competitors would have had more traction if Twitter acted this way from the start.  But they locked us in and then acted in a way inconsistent to what got them the lock-in.  That's bad.  It isn't take to the streets bad.  It isn't quit the service bad.  But it is bad enough to blog and/or comment about.<p>The issue isn't that we want to deny Twitter the ability to profit.  The issue is that Twitter locked us in and now we feel like we don't have other options for that style of communication.  Twitter has become a sort-of monopoly over that type of communication and they might start using that monopoly power not to merely become profitable, but to become more profitable than a competitive market would allow - at our expense.<p>In some ways, it's tough to be a monopolist.  Everyone gets to take shots at you.  In a competitive market, people generally don't take shots so much because they don't care: they'll just move along to something else that makes them happy.  Twitter's changes are making some people unhappy.  Maybe no other service could be profitable doing less - that is entirely possible. It's entirely possible that Twitter is being as awesome as possible and that they're nearly saintly in their devotion to their users needs - as much as is humanly and technologically possible.  However, we don't and won't know that because of Twitter's lock-in and because of that lock-in, these changes might not feel like Twitter trying to merely continue along and earn a modest profit for its investors, but an exercise of power over us.  That sounds more dramatic than I meant it to.  I mean, it's Twitter, not the heart surgery that someone needs.  Still, it's annoying when we feel someone isn't dealing with us in a square way.  When there are loads of competitors, we can say ""well, it just costs about that much to get me a pizza.""  When there's only one competitor, we become less forgiving because monopoly power has been levied against us in the past to our detriment.  There are loads of alternatives to 37signals' products.  There are loads of alternatives to WordPress.com.  There are loads of other local pizza places.  The same isn't true of Twitter.",Twitter
2012-11-17 02:20:07,What Happens When A Twitter Client Hits The Token Limit,"A company builds an API and encourages lots of developers to use it across a wide variety of projects, and they do. After achieving almost unprecedented success in user adoption, the company decides to unilaterally change their terms to say, ""From this day on, not only do we want you to use our API only in ways that drive value to us, we're not really down with you getting any value in return beyond whatever value being able to say 'you can post to Twitter from our app!' brings you."" And they <i>are</i> really down with screwing over existing developers to bring them in line with the New Reality.<p>I'm pretty sure that I would, at that point, <i>not</i> be keen on developing anything that used that API, even if it complied with the new rules, because the company has at that point demonstrated that they <i>will</i> knife me in the back if they think it's going to further their own business goals. How is that reaction ridiculous and immature on my part?",Twitter
2012-11-13 13:41:40,Things that Ruby on Rails people tell you,"&#62; K&#38;R than GoF.<p>Very different comparison to the patterns Fowler presented. The patterns GoF presented were very basic, and were interesting <i>then</i> with languages like C++ when people were still fucking up many of the basic patterns. The number of horribly broken C++ Singleton implementations I've seen, for example, beggars belief. Today that's less of an issue.<p>The patterns Fowler presents are, as the title says, about architecture not low level implementation, and they are patterns you will tend to find in pretty much any large software project today yet that people still manage to fuck up royally, which is the reason the patterns matter.<p>Patters are nothing but recipes of best practice. They're not meant to be ""intriguing"" once you understand the tradeoffs. They're meant to become boring and bland and trivial once people are comfortable with them and their implementation is well understood. They're also meant to give people a shared vocabulary for talking about it. That's the <i>entire</i> <i>point</i>.<p>Most of the patterns in EAR are nowhere that for most people, judging by the code I see regularly and judging by how there's still this cargo cult around the AR pattern by people who in many cases have not even heard about the other ORM patterns presented by Fowler, much less other alternatives.<p>&#62;  There is limited time and large number of books - one has to be picky.<p>If I were to pick <i>any</i> book on software development from the last 10-15 years I'd like everyone to read, it'd be Enterprise Software Architecture, for a simple reason: I still see people using those patterns every day, yet screwing them up in horrible ways. Maybe you don't need it, but the developers I come across for the most part sure do.<p>&#62; Person.where(""last_name = ?"", last_name) is the most concise way to issue that query. Abstracting last_name so that if the field name changes, the query still is relevant is overkill.<p>That is only true if you're dealing with a query that simple (even then, the ""Rails way"" of doing your example would be Person.find_by_lastname(lastname)). On the other hand, I've read the code of dozens of Rails apps that contains several lines long SQL queries littered just because they could.<p>The biggest problem in <i>your</i> example as why you are asking for persons with specific last names in the first place. 9/10 when I see code like that, it is the wrong (too low level) question, and leaks domain logic that should be confined to the model.<p>Also, what happens when you need to serve that query from a web API instead of your database? From a full text engine? From file? From a noSQL database? From on disk hash table? I've had to do all of these - often several from the same application. With a suitable architecture you just plug in your new storage and implement the finders you need supported, and won't have to play ""hunt the raw SQL"". Changing column names is the least of my concerns - that can be fixed with a simple search replace.<p>You also miss the point when you say you can do a base model class and do a mapper yourself: The point is the architecture of AR makes leaking SQL which often ends up in controllers and other places they don't belong all over the place the easy default, while implementing cleaner abstractions is more work.<p>The end result is that most places where AR is used end up with high degrees of coupling for no good reason.<p>If everyone used AR in a disciplined way and avoided littering their controllers and other code with query details that belongs in their models, there wouldn't be a problem.<p>Your argument reminds me of the old memory-protection vs. no memory-protection in the 80's, where the Amiga camp for example tended to be bitterly against memory protection because it was seen as expensive, slow and enabling lazy developers. Expecting developers to write clean code with ActiveRecord is a bit similar to expecting developers to write code free of bad memory accesses without memory protection - it makes it far too easy to do the wrong thing.<p>&#62; github, twitter, heroku et al would like to disagree.<p>And Ebay at least used to be written using ISAPI modules, and large parts of Yahoo runs or used to run on a horrific mess of PHP and Perl (I used to work at Yahoo; there was a lot of dreadful code). Your point again?<p>(and Twitter is a particularly bad example given how much time they spend moaning about how they've needed to move most stuff off Ruby)<p>Besides, pointing to web startups as the pinnacle of engineering quality is ridiculous at best of times - while some of what happens in web startups is amazing, there are also plenty of areas where we're still lagging 20 years behind engineering practices in the enterprise space. Active Record was not by any means a <i>new</i> pattern, for example - none of the patterns in EAR were. They were Fowler's cataloguing of well established patterns with years of use in industry.<p>Rails, and AR, is still better than a lot of the alternatives. That does not mean there are not better ways for a lot of uses than resorting to AR.<p>&#62; Person.where(""last_name = ?"", last_name) makes it unsuitable for large projects?<p>Strawman. If you think simple cases like that is what it is about, you've not seen much complicated Rails code, and it's a waste having this discussion with you.<p>&#62;  It has been long enough to call it time tested.<p>So is BASIC. That doesn't mean it's good. ""Time tested"" is not in itself an argument for anything.<p>&#62;  If Person.where(""last_name = ?"", last_name) is not abstract enough and makes it unsuitable for your projects(still the only concrete complaint from you), look for alternatives.<p>I don't use AR the library unless I absolutely have to, which means I only use it if I help out on Rails projects where I can't dictate policy. Otherwise I'll generally use Sequel, which though it suffers from many similar flaws drawn in large part to inspiration from AR, is cleaner in many ways. There's many things I'd love to change about it, but I already have at twice as much stuff to do as I should.<p>For small projects I might use the Sequel schema module which implements the AR <i>pattern</i>, and which allows for a lot of the same crap that people do with AR the library, but still makes it a lot easier to avoid raw SQL. The AR pattern has its place.<p>But for larger projects I'd generally be inclined to implement mappers, then often with Sequel (<i>without</i> the schema/model module) used internally by the mappers only.",Twitter

Put it another way, could a historian in twenty years time reproduce this data, or does it have to be collected now because no historically useful record is kept? I suspect that online sources actually leave much less historically useful data than, say, newspapers on microfiche, despite online data being much easier to analyse.<p>And secondly, what happens to the data if/when facebook or twitter or google disappear or merge or change massively.

By using your brain.  HTTP does not do typing and so PHP does not do (strong) typing for scalars.  Quite frankly, it makes complete sense to do it that way.  Want an int?  Cast the damn thing and stop complaining.  Dynamic typing significantly reduces the amount of code you need to write and error conditions you need to check for.
It plain works  Programmers have it wrong.  The technical solution is not the end goal.  Technology should be an enabler.  Do you have a wonderful technical solution that doesnt solve a problem?  Bye, bye.  PHP solves problems faster, easier and with a lower cost of ownership than almost anything out there.  A lot of that is based on assumptions (or shortcuts) that PHP takes to solve a problem.  Most often those shortcuts work, and the workarounds are very easy to implement (Im thinking mainly about strict type checking here).</i><p>Little does the author know that you can have dynamic typing in any statically-typed language:<p><pre><code>   /** Immutable scalar value. */

All PHP adds are operators like + that are typed Scalar -&#62; Scalar instead of Number -&#62; Number, making up arbitrary behavior for non-numeric values.  If you wanted dynamic typing in Java, you would just write a special math library over your Scalar type and write your application in terms of those operations instead of the built-in ones.  The reason nobody does that is because the static typing, though verbose, makes for nice self-documentation.<p>At some point you need to decide on a type for a value and most people try to do that as soon as possible.  When I write in a dynamically typed language that's not Python, I usually assert well-formedness immediately after reading the data from outside my program.  At that point, dynamic typing is a <i>loss</i> in safety to me.   (When I write Python, I never explicitly check types and let mistyped operations fail at runtime, because that's the convention.)<p>Anyway, that was a fun article.",Twitter
2012-05-02 13:59:42,Simplicity Matters By Rich Hickey (Keynote at RailsConf 2012),"With web services, documents are your public API.

It is anti-social to change that API on developers.<p>These documents are very complex. Just take a look at a twitter timeline JSON response.  Having a getter and setter for every field in that document would get ridiculous.<p>The problem with JSON is it is so easy to change that it takes self discipline to enforce your own social contract.

2012-03-26 17:11:32,Using Objective-C On The Server,"A few months ago I was making plans for what is now my home base website for App Store &#38; other projects. I'd been working in obj-c for about 2 years both on the Mac and on iOS, but also had a fair bit of python experience with Django, App Engine, etc. I decided to give it a shot with obj-c.<p>I knew about the handful of ""big"" frameworks for handling this task with obj-c, but rejected them in favor of getting more hands-on experience building it, pushing myself and learning in the process. It was, of course, a personal project, something I alone was responsible for working with, so I decided it was OK if I experimented a little.<p>I went into the project knowing I would eventually have to port it to Python (and I did), but it was a lot of fun :)<p>I hand picked some lightweight libraries to handle specific parts of the server. One has to be cautious knowing that a library developer who thinks their sole target is a tiny cellphone, may not be worrying about things you will eventually have to worry about on a server.<p>I picked CocoaHTTPServer to handle requests and responses, and someone else had written a nicer ""route"" style interface for it which meant all of the possible responses to an http request were simply a series of blocks defined in a row, each with a regex or named parameter style URL route defined right there next to the code that would handle it. This works out to be quite a similar layout in code as something like Bottle/Python or Express/Node.js, both of which I've worked with now and I very much prefer this style.<p>I made good use of blocks &#38; dispatch queues elsewhere as well, firing off an async block whenever I needed to pull new tweets from Twitter's api, or update Github repo stats (both are cached and displayed on the site).<p>I picked a Mustache template library and a Markdown parser library I found on Github for handling dynamic page generation &#38; blog post syntax, respectively. Sqlite for storing anything that needed to be stored, Regexkit-lite for properly checking and handling anything that may be passed in to a url query or post body, etc.<p>I changed the Xcode project type to build me an executable binary that lived inside a bundle (Server.bundle) containing all the pages and assets the thing needed, so it could be deployed as a single ""thing"".<p>I also got Lion's sandboxing to work quite easily, which in theory would give some moderate protection against the entire server being compromised if someone managed to get an exploit to run inside the process.<p>Other than some CPU usage issues with the template library (easily solved by nginx caching pages), it all worked really, really well. I threw enough abuse at it, and did enough debugging that I was confident it would hold up well in production (which turned out to be wrong).<p>And then it came time to deploy somewhere, a problem I had been working on since day one, so i knew what i was getting in to.<p>There were only a few options: a cross-compiler framework like Cocotron (compile on Mac, run on Linux), one of the native *step libraries like GNUstep running on Linux or FreeBSD, or simply deploy on a Mac somewhere.<p>I tried all combinations other than Mac first, I built out a GNUstep environment with libobjc2 on FreeBSD, tried the cocotron-&#62;linux stuff, each time watching something blow up in my face due to my choice of components and my requirements.<p>While obj-c is cross platform, some of the libraries and features I chose to use were not. CocoaHTTPServer is built on top of CFNetwork, which is not part of any obj-c framework/library, but rather a lower level Apple C library only found on Macs. There's a ""lite"" open source version, but I quickly discovered that solving one issue like that would only bring up another. For instance, dispatch blocks will only work with GNUstep at the moment, and only when it is compiled with clang, against libobjc2, a combination few if any Linux distros actually ship in their repos.<p>Not a lot of people interested in deploying modern, dispatch/block-heavy, obj-c 2.0 code to Linux, not nearly as many as there are deploying such things to OS X or iOS.<p>So I decided why not just run on a Mac server somewhere? After all I can't solve every problem all at the same time, and on a Mac a lot of those problems were non-existent, plus the Mac approach would allow me to use things only available on a Mac, like easy sandboxing and potentially keychain integration for auth.<p>I found a Mac VPS provider that ran Xserves and hosted copies of Lion server inside VMware (HostMyApple, not someone fudging the licensing in moms basement). It worked really, really well, as long as I treated it like a headless server (issues with Lion Server are another story for another time). My sandboxing worked, performance was fantastic aside from the CPU usage during a cache miss, so I was fairly happy.<p>Long story short though, memory leaks in 3rd party libraries (that only someone running a server would likely hit), coupled with higher hosting costs (and fewer choices), smaller community and a desire to use some things that are really only ""mature"" in other languages (database adapters, etc), caused me to spend a few days porting the entire thing to Python.<p>My site now runs on a Linode, and is a nearly identical clone of the obj-c version, ported as a Python/Bottle app. There was nothing particularly wrong with the obj-c approach, but the primary focus of nearly all obj-c developers and libraries is iOS, where processes never live longer than a few minutes, or Mac where a crash or leak is only going to affect one person rather than a few hundred in-flight requests. I expect if I had stuck with one of the ""frameworks"" intended for this purpose it would have been a viable option but as I said before I wasn't looking for turn-key, but wanting to get my hands dirty :)",Twitter

OP brings up a good point that using only GET/PUT/POST/DELETE to only represent CRUD is extremely limiting, but suggests that using even more obscure HTTP methods would be less limiting? I would argue not only is it limiting, it is also obscure, what is it about ""PUT"" that implies update vs. create?<p>If you look at the twitter API (<a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api</a>) (commonly held up as exemplary REST) you will see exactly 2 methods, GET and POST. GET means no state change other than logging, POST implies state change.

A lot of Facebook the Facebook API is pretty good - well documented, clear and simple. And however bad Oauth 2.0 might be, Oauth 1.1 is worse. Oauth 1.1 is pathologically irrational.<p>And Facebook is only, ONLY directly responsible for THE API ITSELF. If they've maintained some Java or Python stuff, that's right nice of them but it's not their main job. If you are complaining about particular SDKs offered by Facebook, you aren't complaining about ""The Facebook Platform"", you're just complaining. When they change the interface (as they've done several times), then complain.<p>I think the site's motto probably explains things better ""Of course it sucks, it's made of software"".",Twitter
2011-11-12 19:57:50,Flash is dead. Long live the internet.,"I felt the exact same way for a very, very long time. A few things changed my mind.<p>The first was the realization that Adobe wasn't going to make any more cool fun stuff for me. I feel like they've just lost their way with all that and now that I look back on it, it seems like Macromedia actually made all the aspects of Flash that I enjoy. The most recent thing Adobe has done for me is Stage3D but even that is so technical that they're relying on 3rd parties like Away3D to build the friendly API on top of it.<p>The second was doing a project that was as close to an art piece as I've ever come doing ad agency work that was entirely in HTML/CSS3 and JS. It was actually this project if you want to see some pictures: <a href=""http://inchwormstudio.com/?portfolio=samsung-coast-to-coast-photo-post"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inchwormstudio.com/?portfolio=samsung-coast-to-coast-...</a>
What I found while I was doing that project was that the web has changed a lot while I've been doing Flash and I didn't realize how much annoying obtuse boilerplate I had to write in AS3 that just becomes total cake when you're using HTML for markup, CSS for style and JS for slick transitions and communication. My main love affair is with HTML and JS, I still think CSS is...CSS. With HTML I'm getting all the great structural stuff that Flex devs love, without the mind numblingly elaborate class structures they have to deal with. With good JS libraries like jQuery I'm getting the cross browser DOM support that I need because I just don't have those sea legs yet. And when you combine it all you can work really, really fast. I spent the whole first half of that project cursing JavaScript up and down the office. I would make little examples showing how setInterval loses scope and demo it for my team and be like ""look! this stuff is retarded! I want AS3 back!"" Then one day I had to build this twitter widget, and I sat down and I just cranked it out in no time. And I thought, 'You know, if I had been doing this in Flash I would have spent so much time dealing with URLLoaders and cross policy files and coreLib for JSON parsing...' It just felt like things had gone smoother because I wasn't fighting against the web to make it fit inside my Flash app. And that was about the time that I felt like I got over the hump, and from there it was all downhill.<p>It totally had warts and I got stung by IE transparency bugs but in the end we sorted it all out and now I know how to deal with those issues. And to be honest, they were pretty minimal. The Facebook API was far worse than the cross browser stuff.<p>If you're making the transition then read this: <a href=""http://jqfundamentals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqfundamentals.com/</a>
I read it start to finish and it made things so much easier for me. Then once you're comfortable with jQuery, leave it behind and try the other stuff. It feels like there is SO much more to experiment with in the JS world than the AS world and I think that's largely because the community is exponentially larger. Hope that's helpful.",Twitter

(Who do Buxfer,etc use?)","UPDATE: textmarks has an API. wow. there a total winner then <a href=""http://textmarks.com/dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://textmarks.com/dev</a><p>Sorry I was sleeping&#62; Anyways here is your answer. 1. If you are broke, like me then consider using an email to sms gateway. you will need to know the subscriber's provider. It can work if you are offering a one-way sms service such as updates. Watch out for SMSC spam catchers . 2. If you have money, but no time then you can use a provider such as Clickatell or Verisign and they will do all the background work. All you will need is an access to their API plus a monthly fee of 500-1500/month on top of SMS fees. 3. You have money plus time plus contacts then Forget all these guys and provision your own short-code, then start emailing your contacts at Verizon and them to  give you access to their SMSC. When people say ""I don't know how twitter pays for 250k SMS/month"" they don't know that Twitter is probably paying less than your startup will for 10k SMS. that is the advantage of working directly with the carriers. SMS is super cheap for them. 4. You got money, but want to be careful, then I suggest <a href=""http://mobivity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobivity.com</a> or <a href=""http://textmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://textmarks</a>. This service charge you for zero to only a few bucks and give you a unique keyword plus short-code. You can easily talk to Greg Harris who is the CEO of Mobivity and he is very open to entrepreneurs looking to use his service which is why he has an API.I mean  he will literally let you launch a product competing with his. Textmarks doesn't have an API to my knowledge but you can certainly email Ariel Poller. i would try something like apoller or a.poller@textmarks.com. Be smart when you choose a provider that offers a short-code.When you rent a shared short-code, it can change at any time and now your 50k users have to know your new short-code. If you are doing a interactive SMS service, that can suck. If you are going for the private short-code, then you are safe as a long as you can shell out 1000/month. If you are proficient with Mobile applications, the best way to go is to build your own messaging application. Now when someone sends you a SMS or you send your user a sms ask send them a link as well and ask them to download it. there you have it, no more SMS fees for that guy and your messages can be 500 characters long. OOps I gotta go make more coffee. Email me if you like and I can be more detailed, i just went on here without knowing exactly what you are doing.",Twitter
2011-04-14 00:30:50,Ask HN: How are lean startups easily accepting CC payments?,"If you want something simple without writing much code, go with PayPal. You'd expect some ""horror stories"" from a payment processor with 232 million accounts. Virtually all of them involve someone doing something that'd raise flags at any merchant account provider or bank, it's just that people think PayPal isn't a bank so they should be able to get away with anything. 10,000 horror stories still leaves 99.99% of users happy.<p>If you want to accept credit cards on your own site, you need to learn about PCIDSS compliance, you need to apply for a merchant account, and you need to a payment gateway that works with that merchant account.<p>It's well within reach of a lean startup. The application is usually a page or two long, you'll get approval from the underwriting bank within a week or so, and most MAPs also resell the payment gateway accounts so they set that up for you and you get everything at once. The fixed costs will be a statement fee and a gateway fee, $20-30 a month total.<p>It's terribly difficult to understand the fees you'll be paying with a merchant account. They're far more complex than whatever you get quoted will lead you to expect, and it's absolutely common for providers to change the fees on a monthly basis such that after a year you have no idea what you're paying. There can be dozens of classes of credit cards each with different rates when you charge them. My only advice for dealing with that is to try not to tie your code to your processor so that, when you grow enough for the fees to matter, you can shop around for a better deal.<p>You don't get to take shortcuts with the PCI stuff. The fine for a credit card being compromised from your server because you weren't PCIDSS compliant start at $500,000 per incident (paid to Visa/MC) plus legal fees and costs to provide credit monitoring to the victims.<p>If you accept credit cards directly on your site, you'll be required to fill out a self-assessment questionnaire and have a compliance scan against your server run on some basis. For most ecommerce setups, it'll be quarterly. What that costs depends on your merchant account provider; some contract with and pay a compliance company for you, others you have to pay some or all of the costs yourself, which can be a couple hundred dollars a year. SecurityMetrics seems to be the most popular service for the scans.<p>The technical part is easy. An Authorize.net integration will take you a couple hours <i>at most</i>. There are libraries for the popular payment gateways in every programming language known to man, and prebuilt shopping carts will have plugins/modules/whatever written by people already.<p>It's just like any other API. You POST some data to some server to make a charge/authorization/refund/etc and get a response to parse.

Spolski was complaining that Microsoft invents too much new frameworks, but the truth is that even though there're 10s new frameworks, the old ones are still there and they will work if you need to use them in your rusty old LoB application.

While we certainly strive to have as few issues pop up as possible they seem to be an inevitability.<p>That being said we aren't satisfied with the number of regressions that currently pop up and have instituted a number of changes into our development process:<p><pre><code>    - Significant core rewrites now only occur during
      major (1.x) releases.
    - New features are only added during major releases.
    - APIs are only added/removed/changed during major
      releases (unchanged, we've always done this).
    - Behavior of specific API calls are only
      changed during major releases.
</code></pre>
We've also changed our workflow. We're now doing minor (1.x.x) releases roughly every month and major (1.x) releases every three months. Thus we can still get a good flow of good features out in a consistent manner.<p>I should also mention that the jQuery core development team has <i>many</i> more people helping out now. Active participation has always been a challenge for the team (bug triage and fixing isn't very glamorous). We now have about 8 people who are entirely dedicated to bug triage, test case creation, and prioritization. These people work closely with the core dev team (which has recently more than doubled in size).<p>All of this will help to significantly improve the quality of releases (and has done so quite well with 1.4.4 - 1.4.4 was a very good release, better than 1.4.3. I suspect that if Twitter had issues with upgrading from 1.4.2 to 1.4.4 it was because they had issues with 1.4.3).",Twitter
2011-01-13 20:45:18,Twitter API bug still not fixed 3 years later,"Heh, good ol' issue 214. I get Google issue alerts about it every time someone complains.<p>I don't think this will ever be fixed. If Twitter hasn't officially deprecated the search API in favor of the streaming API, they have de facto, by not making any significant changes in the search API in years. The streaming API still can't do everything the search API can, but it has gotten somewhat close.",Twitter
2010-11-23 10:47:12,Why you absolutely MUST write an API when you write your next app,"I'm a little more cautious about this and would suggest three caveats:<p>1. Building an API from day one can be premature. Typically when you start building something is the time when you know the least about the problem you're trying to solve and the issues you'll face solving it. That problem is subject to much more change early than late. If you build an API on day one may just be creating more work for yourself later on;<p>2. If you provide a public API, you are quite possibly exposing your data model and any assumptions that underpin it. This can make it much harder to change later as circumstances change. Think of it as making everything (including data members) public in class. It's abstraction; and<p>3. What value does an API provide <i>you</i> as the service provider?<p>Twitter is an easy example of this: it doesn't really matter where the Tweets (sorry nytimes) come from as Twitter owns the graph, the distribution and the Tweets.<p>Now consider a site like Stackoverflow. What if you could ask questions, search for answers, vote, view your summary information and so on completely via an API. What value would there be in the SO site? Not much at all and it's the ads on those pages that pay for the site (well that and $x million from USV).",Twitter
2010-08-22 13:51:17,"Foursquare iPhone app sends passwords in plain text, don't use","Ok - so welcome to last year?  I recall a PyCon talk on security a few years ago where one of the speaker's first slides was a list of passwords with the text ""if this is your Twitter password, change it, then change your Twitter client.""<p>Most of these startups treat the iPhone as if it were some magical device that's plugged straight into their API.  I actually participated on a Get Satisfaction thread for Gowalla where one person claimed they liked that it was iPhone only (which dates how long ago it was) because it made it ""secure"" and couldn't be ""hacked the way Foursquare can.""<p>Needless to say, they were disabused of that notion pretty quickly when checked in at the Gug, the Apple flagship store in London, and my home within the space of 30 seconds.  It literally took 3 minutes to figure out - most of which was spent setting up my iPhone to proxy through my laptop.  They were (and keep in mind, this is back when Gowalla was still iPhone only) sending everything in clear text.<p>They also didn't regenerate session IDs for anything at the time.  I logged out and logged back in, same session ID.  I logged out via my iPhone, loaded up their site and changed my password, then logged back in, same session ID.  Basically, once you had sniffed one session ID you were set.  I tried it a week later and was still able to use the same session ID without any problem.<p>It's amazing that things like session hijacking are so unknown and unfamiliar to people people relying on web frameworks to do everything for them. At the time they were using Merb---I found out by hitting an ""/unknown/and/unknowable/"" page and seeing their backtrace output.  Session hijacking is a solved problem, why they were subject to it I can't fathom.",Twitter
2009-08-21 03:10:42,Creating Dynamic Websites with Lisp and Apache,"Maybe I can write that much needed Hunchentoot 1.0.0 document. All the tutorials are for version 0.15.7; the API has changed since.<p>There are two issues involved here: 1) Do you want a ""web app"", or do you want a web <i>platform</i>. It's trivial to get an app up and running in 15 minutes. install hunchentoot, load it into your Lisp of choice and fire away (start by writing handlers, using CL-WHO.)<p>If you want a <i>platfrom</i>, then there are many many engineering decisions to be made. Performance, scalability, security, availability and most of all easy of deployment, development, upgrade and code aesthetics. You can use fastcgi and write Lisp scripts for Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd or any other industrial strength web server. Over the last few weeks I have hacked together various things that should be useful to people; an RBAC implementation, a Redis based message queue, some rudimentary code for managing server farms, etc.<p>You can use your RDBMS of choice; CL-SQL, Postmodern and Cl-Perec are all powerful ORMs and middleware. There also NoSQL solutions readily available to make you both proud and buzz-word compatible.<p>Read Cliki and you can find everything you need to create a URL shortner or a twitter clone right there.<p>Scheme community should have similar tools as well, though they're  a bit more fragmented than we are.",Twitter

2009-03-25 00:07:45,Ask YC: Feedback on our new service: messagepub.com,"The service sounds interesting, although the pricing is way too high for me (more on that later). I apologize if I sound harsh in my feedback, I'd be equally harsh to one of my own projects too. That said:<p>1) The color you've chosen for ""pub"" (#FFF191) doesn't contrast with the white background enough. I find it hard to read. The same problem arises in reverse on the ""Free Trial"" badge.<p>2) ""A dead-simple messaging API and web service"" doesn't do it for me. I still have no idea what your product is.<p>Spell it out for me:<p>""Get your app talking to Twitter, AIM, and Google Talk in 5 minutes.""<p>3) The goal of the homepage is to tell me what your product is before losing my attention. The best way to do that is getting me to watch a video. Make your video the center of attention on the homepage and optimize for getting people to watch it.<p>4) I like the bullet points, but just stick with the first set (no animation). I would also remove the last one, ""A cost effective solution!"", as it sounds like you made up a 5th item to round out the list. I would also make the copy more active.<p>5) The upgrade IE6 message is inappropriate for a business website, especially when trying to sell a web service to web developers. You're trying to convince me that I can trust your library to handle all the nuanced use cases that would take me weeks to discover. Remember, I'm a developer so I'm looking for a reason to write my own library - don't give me one.<p>So if I see ""function showUnsupportedBrowserAlert()"" in your Javascript it says 2 things to me:<p>- Your site doesn't render correctly in IE6<p>- You don't care enough to fix it<p>That's doesn't give me confidence in your messaging library, which is far more complex than HTML/CSS.<p>Also, suppose someone does come to the site with IE6, or a browser incorrectly identified as IE6. You're effectively turning them away, is that really what you want to do? What exactly is broken in IE6 and what would it take to fix it?<p>6) The video on the homepage doesn't perform well as a sales tool (I'm not sure if it was meant to).<p>I'd make a video that starts with you typing a message into an example app and clicking send. Then your AIM, Twitter, and GTalk alert new messages while your phone rings to play the message back with surprisingly high fidelity. Then show me the 2 lines of code it took (but don't show the install process or have me watch you type out code).<p>7) Pricing - I'd switch away from using different prices for Email/GChat/AIM/Twitter. Even if I'm a current customer it makes them too tempting to replace one by one. If I'm already integrating with your web service whats so hard about integrating with theirs?<p>If its feasible I would include a ton of free credits for those services in a monthly subscription, and make your money charging for SMS and speech-to-text over the phone. SMS is a traditionally expensive technology, and both it and phone are much harder to implement than a web service.<p>I might also change from 1 cent per message to $1 for 100 messages. To me it sounds cheaper, even though it isn't.<p>I'd also provide a way for your website to call me with a message I've typed in to showcase your text-to-speech accuracy.<p>That's about all I've got. Best of luck with the service!",Twitter

2018-07-05 23:08:09,"Vue.js: the good, the meh, and the ugly","For one: vue, vuex (centralized state library) and vue-router are stewarted by roughly the same people, which has a few benefits. The documentation is all pretty decent and uniform. I never sit for very long wondering how to do something.<p>Changes that break backwards compatibility are reflected across all three at the same time, and the correct versions are installed by vue-cli. I had several starts with react, react-router, and redux, and on almost every occasion something from my last attempt was broken because the api had changed, and the documentation changed with it (in the span of 3-4 months). That lead to several WTF moments. IIRC there was a period where react-router made some breaking changes from v2 to v3, and then less than a year later made more breaking changes for v4.<p>Vue is also a lot simpler to drop into an existing application. The .vue single-file component is very approachable, albeit a bit magic but about as magic as JSX. You can add a vue-loader for sass&#x2F;less&#x2F;etc. and simply specify lang=&quot;less&quot; in these as well.<p>Vuex was a little easier for me to grok, although I had the advantage of trying out redux first. It has the advantage again of sharing documentation with the rest of the project.<p>Also, because react has worked for big companies as you mentioned, does not mean vue couldn&#x27;t work for them as well. React gained a lot of momentum early among western programmers. Vue first gained traction in Asia - Evan You, the creator of vue, is from there. Also you might remember the massive amount of confusion for early React adopters regarding how to manage state. People liked react, but it only really had the view part ready out of the gate. Facebook&#x27;s explanation of what the early-best-practice flux model entailed was vague, and there were several slightly different implementations.",Facebook

2018-07-03 01:29:50,Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid is a platform designed to re-decentralize the web,"There are two closely intertwined but separate issues: centralization and governance.<p>Current web technology typically sees one entity controlling the data; if you sign up for a website, your data goes in their database.  That&#x27;s due to the common stack we all build on: some form of API&#x2F;web server, some form of SQL&#x2F;NoSQL database, some form of client.  If we had a world where developers could simply and freely implement services on top of a <i>different</i> paradigm, we&#x27;d stop having to worry about big central entities like Facebook, Google, your local computer store, whoever -- being able to sell your data.  They simply wouldn&#x27;t have it.  I&#x27;m not sure what that paradigm is, but IPFS, Secure Scuttlebutt, Solid, the Dat Project etc. are all interesting takes on what a solution to that problem might look like.<p>At the other end of the spectrum is governance, which is something sorely lacking, and allows these misinformation campaigns to spread so freely.  Do we still have to worry about governance in a world where we own our own data?  Yes, probably, if the surge of illegal and genuinely nasty content like Child Pornography on the new big distributed networks (eg. ZeroNet) is any indicator.  Censorship is a spectrum, and while I can appreciate sticking to the view that free speech is best for all, there are some behaviours which society has mostly agreed are objectionable.<p>The current paradigm of each social service provider essentially being a self-determining fiefdom isn&#x27;t too dissimilar to how humaity&#x27;s always done things, I guess (for instance, different pubs&#x2F;bars will have differing clienteles and degrees of socially acceptable behaviour), except for the scale -- which unfortunately probably does merit a change in how our current major sites are run (YouTube and Twitter in particular seem like they&#x27;ve been gamed incredibly well by cynical parties).  I don&#x27;t know how we solve this problem, but better technical underpinnings might make this a simpler problem to solve.  Independently, however, I note that there are places like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.coop</a> where they&#x27;re trying to take that problem on head-first.<p>It will be interesting to see what the next few years of the internet look like.  My hope is that we see some of the people interested in this problem start focussing on normal people instead of other techies; suggesting to my friends that they move to Secure Scuttlebutt is pretty hard, as the majority of them really only use their phones (or tablets).<p>Personally, I think something that tied together messaging and an event invitation&#x2F;calendaring system would take a <i>massive</i> knock out of the people who are only hanging onto Facebook for those two things, but that&#x27;s still a techy view of &quot;kill centralisation&quot; and not a social view of &quot;how does that new platform get governed?&quot;.",Facebook

Facebook didn&#x27;t restrict their API because they were privacy-conscious. They restricted it so you could not build experiences they did not want:<p>- You cannot sync your address book contacts with facebook in order to get profile pictures (you used to be able to do this)<p>- You cannot write an alternative Facebook client (with a better timeline, no ads, ...)<p>- You cannot write a complete bridge to another social network (e.g. implement Federation)<p>- You cannot build a P2P (serverless) application over Facebook. E.g. a chat, or something to send a file to a friend on Facebook, or to initiate a TeamViewer-like session.<p>All of these are either explicity forbidden by policy, or have been closed by specific changed to their API.<p>To be honest, I don&#x27;t care too much that people were able to scrape data I put up voluntarily. The German Facebook clone was called StudiVZ - Student&#x27;s Directory. This sounds a lot like a telephone book, and that was the mindset and expectation I had when signing up to Facebook. Create and curate a profile for friends and friends-of-friends to see, and I didn&#x27;t care much if others saw anything, because it was irrelevant to them. I mostly cared about meeting people - being found, and finding other people. In this light, I&#x27;m more concerned about data freedom than data protection.

You don’t do that for anyone else.”<p>It is worth thinking about.<p>As a teenage Apple computer fan, Jobs and Wozniak were revered figures for me, and wanting an Apple 2 was a defining characteristic of several years of my childhood. Later on, seeing NeXT at a computer show just as I was selling my first commercial software felt like a vision into the future. (But $10k+, yikes!)<p>As Id Software grew successful through Commander Keen and Wolfenstein 3D, the first major personal purchase I made wasn’t a car, but rather a NeXT computer. It turned out to be genuinely valuable for our software development, and we moved the entire company onto NeXT hardware.<p>We loved our NeXTs, and we wanted to launch Doom with an explicit “Developed on NeXT computers” logo during the startup process, but when we asked, the request was denied.<p>Some time after launch, when Doom had begun to make its cultural mark, we heard that Steve had changed his mind and would be happy to have NeXT branding on it, but that ship had sailed. I did think it was cool to trade a few emails with Steve Jobs.<p>Several things over the years made me conclude that, at his core, Steve didn’t think very highly of games, and always wished they weren’t as important to his platforms as they turned out to be. I never took it personally.<p>When NeXT managed to sort of reverse-acquire Apple and Steve was back in charge, I was excited by the possibilities of a resurgent Apple with the virtues of NeXT in a mainstream platform.<p>I was brought in to talk about the needs of games in general, but I made it my mission to get Apple to adopt OpenGL as their 3D graphics API. I had a lot of arguments with Steve.<p>Part of his method, at least with me, was to deride contemporary options and dare me to tell him differently. They might be pragmatic, but couldn’t actually be good. “I have Pixar. We will make something [an API] that is actually good.”<p>It was often frustrating, because he could talk, with complete confidence, about things he was just plain wrong about, like the price of memory for video cards and the amount of system bandwidth exploitable by the AltiVec extensions.<p>But when I knew what I was talking about, I would stand my ground against anyone.<p>When Steve did make up his mind, he was decisive about it. Dictates were made, companies were acquired, keynotes were scheduled, and the reality distortion field kicked in, making everything else that was previously considered into obviously terrible ideas.<p>I consider this one of the biggest indirect impacts on the industry that I have had. OpenGL never seriously threatened D3D on PC, but it was critical at Apple, and that meant that it remained enough of a going concern to be the clear choice when mobile devices started getting GPUs. While long in the tooth now, it was so much better than what we would have gotten if half a dozen SoC vendors rolled their own API back at the dawn of the mobile age.<p>I wound up doing several keynotes with Steve, and it was always a crazy fire drill with not enough time to do things right, and generally requiring heroic effort from many people to make it happen at all. I tend to think this was also a calculated part of his method.<p>My first impression of “Keynote Steve” was him berating the poor stage hands over “This Home Depot shit” that was rolling out the display stand with the new Mac, very much not to his satisfaction. His complaints had a valid point, and he improved the quality of the presentation by caring about details, but I wouldn’t have wanted to work for him in that capacity.<p>One time, my wife, then fiancé, and I were meeting with Steve at Apple, and he wanted me to do a keynote that happened to be scheduled on the same day as our wedding. With a big smile and full of charm, he suggested that we postpone it. We declined, but he kept pressing. Eventually my wife countered with a suggestion that if he really wanted “her” John so much, he should loan John Lassiter to her media company for a day of consulting. Steve went from full charm to ice cold really damn quick. I didn’t do that keynote.<p>When I was preparing an early technology demo of Doom 3 for a keynote in Japan, I was having a hard time dealing with some of the managers involved that were insisting that I change the demo because “Steve doesn’t like blood.” I knew that Doom 3 wasn’t to his taste, but that wasn’t the point of doing the demo.<p>I brought it to Steve, with all the relevant people on the thread. He replied to everyone with:<p>“I trust you John, do whatever you think is great.”<p>That goes a long way, and nobody said a thing after that.<p>When my wife and I later started building games for feature phones (DoomRPG! Orcs&amp;Elves!), I advocated repeatedly to Steve that an Apple phone could be really great. Every time there was a rumor that Apple might be working on a phone, I would refine the pitch to him. Once he called me at home on a Sunday (How did he even get my number?) to ask a question, and I enthused at length about the possibilities.<p>I never got brought into the fold, but I was excited when the iPhone actually did see the light of day. A giant (for the time) true color display with a GPU! We could do some amazing things with this!<p>Steve first talked about application development for iPhone at the some keynote I was demonstrating the new ID Tech 5 rendering engine on Mac, so I was in the front row. When he started going on about “Web Apps”, I was (reasonably quietly) going “Booo!!!”.<p>After the public cleared out and the rest of us were gathered in front of the stage, I started urgently going on about how web apps are terrible, and wouldn’t show the true potential of the device. We could do so much more with real native access!<p>Steve responded with a line he had used before: “Bad apps could bring down cell phone towers.” I hated that line. He could have just said “We aren’t ready”, and that would have been fine.<p>I was making some guesses, but I argued that the iPhone hardware and OS provided sufficient protection for native apps. I pointed at a nearby engineer and said “Don’t you have an MMU and process isolation on the iPhone now?” He had a wide eyed look of don’t-bring-me-into-this, but I eventually got a “yes” out of him.<p>I said that OS-X was surely being used for things that were more security critical than a phone, and if Apple couldn’t provide enough security there, they had bigger problems. He came back with a snide “You’re a smart guy John, why don’t you write a new OS?” At the time, my thought was, “Fuck you, Steve.”.<p>People were backing away from us. If Steve was mad, Apple employees didn’t want him to associate the sight of them with the experience. Afterwards, one of the execs assured me that “Steve appreciates vigorous conversation”.<p>Still deeply disappointed about it, I made some comments that got picked up by the press. Steve didn’t appreciate that.<p>The Steve Jobs “hero &#x2F; shithead” rollercoaster was real, and after riding high for a long time, I was now on the down side. Someone told me that Steve explicitly instructed them to not give me access to the early iPhone SDK when it finally was ready.<p>I wound up writing several successful iPhone apps on the side (all of which are now gone due to dropping 32 bit support, which saddens me), and I had many strong allies inside Apple, but I was on the outs with Steve.<p>The last iOS product I worked on was Rage for iOS, which I thought set a new bar for visual richness on mobile, and also supported some brand new features like TV out. I heard that it was well received inside Apple.<p>I was debriefing the team after the launch when I got a call. I was busy, so I declined it. A few minutes later someone came in and said that Steve was going to call me. Oops.<p>Everyone had a chuckle about me “hanging up on Steve Jobs”, but that turned out to be my last interaction with him.<p>As the public story of his failing health progressed, I started several emails to try to say something meaningful and positive to part on, but I never got through them, and I regret it.<p>I corroborate many of the negative character traits that he was infamous for, but elements of the path that led to where I am today were contingent on the dents he left in the universe.<p>I showed up for him.",Facebook

2018-04-25 11:41:10,Startup School Beijing,"You can make an exact comparison. Not too terribly long ago I saw protests holding up poster sized pictures of prisoner abuse from Abu Gharib and Guantanamo Bay, which is roughly like holding up a poster-sized picture from the 1989 massacre. Nothing happened to these people in spite of the fact that these pictures are deeply embarrassing to the US government and intensely inflammatory in regions of the world where we don&#x27;t want to be inflammatory.<p>As much as I give Snowden credit for exposing what can be dangerous autocratic programs, I also must point out that Snowden was not just some random protester. Snowden violated a government secrecy oath that he signed, which is a crime and this fact is printed rather boldly on the contract. Nobody forces you to sign these oaths. You can always say &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I can&#x27;t sign this, I quit&quot; and walk out and get another job.<p>That&#x27;s part of what &quot;the rule of law&quot; actually means. In a nation with the rule of law, the law applies objectively to everyone: crooks, politicians, and yes even do-gooders. If the law is wrong you can vote for representatives to change it, but until then what&#x27;s written is the law. If the law says it&#x27;s illegal to hop on a pogo stick, then anyone hopping on a pogo stick gets arrested even if they&#x27;re on their way to feed starving orphans.<p>(Secret courts are another matter, and I think those are un-American and should be shut down. But they are used far less in America than in China, and when they are used and the fact becomes known there&#x27;s generally quite an uproar.)<p>Also-- personally I find the NSA and CIA less alarming than Facebook and Google. Three-letter agencies operate with at least some democratic oversight and the intel they gather does tend to be used primarily for legitimate intelligence and national security purposes.

2018-04-24 08:14:40,Europe’s New Privacy Rules Favor Google and Facebook,"Due to the GDPR Facebook added all kinds of new controls. I looked through them today.<p>Stuff Facebook has tracked, despite not using their app on my phone (preloaded but completely disabled) and using their website only with uBlock Origin):<p>a) everywhere you ever used Facebook to login to a website. I thought I never did this but apparently I still had 5+ websites linked to this. They seem to use this to profile you. Facebook mentions about this _&quot;These are active apps and websites. This means that you recently logged in to them using Facebook, and they can request information you&#x27;ve chosen to share with them.&quot;_ I never wanted to share anything, but Facebook often changes settings or pretends I did<p>b) every time you connected an app to your Facebook account. Apparently I again did at a few times (to easily upload some photos). I also saw old phones in here, Runkeeper (don&#x27;t recall using that), Tinder (haven&#x27;t used in years). All of those seem to forever be able to get information from you.<p>c) topics (yet another new name). Not sure how they figured things like that out. Fortunately you can completely disable the personal tracking, though you need to do that in various different places.<p>d) advertisers whom added their contact list to Facebook. Really!! So some other company shared my details with Facebook. Which means they&#x27;ve also shared details of people not using Facebook with Facebook.<p>e) used websites and apps. This is surprisingly accurate and complete (hundreds of sites+apps!), despite having the Fb app disabled plus always using uBlock Origin. I really wonder if they somehow are able to retrieve the browser history. It seems Facebook also tracks you using &quot;apps using Facebook technology&quot;, which I guess is a library to show ads or something which uses the app permissions to further track the user.<p>f) it uses your profile (relationship status, employer, job title, education) to targets ads<p>g) somehow puts you into categories. E.g. &quot;uses a mobile device (xx to xx months)&quot;. I disabled this crap yesterday, it updated it today with more information. I assume through Whatsapp&#x2F;Instagram or maybe some kind of Facebook ad library? Again, I don&#x27;t want it to track me, yet they seem to be easily able to do this. I turned off all the settings but apparently still missed a few.<p>i) ads topics. Not sure how topics differs from the 3 other ways they call this.<p>j) your location. It doesn&#x27;t show what it does with this. You cannot disable the location tracking; it suggests to turn it off in the phone settings (which is a cop-out). I&#x27;ll need to download my data to further determine this. I&#x27;m pretty sure Facebook is big enough to figure out additional ways of location tracking than just what Android&#x2F;iPhone allows.<p>k) websites visited. I assume any link clicked. This is somehow different than all the other ways it already showed websites.<p>l) the existing &quot;Who can contact you using email address &#x2F; phone number&quot;. It says &quot;Who&quot;, but it is used for the API as well, that&#x27;s not a user so I find the usage of &quot;Who&quot; misleading.<p>Despite doing all of this, still not sure how to prevent something like Cambridge Analytica from downloading my data through others (&quot;friend&quot;).

2018-04-09 03:35:10,Smartphone Security: You'll Never Guess Who Just Messaged You,"I can imagine how this evolved -- somewhere at Apple HQ, a whiteboarding session about classes of information and capabilities that the OS will gatekeep, which got us to Contacts, Photos, Camera, Microphone, Location. Presumably apps would be extensively curated, keeping out the scummiest of the lot, and apps were envisioned as asking for permissions directly relevant to their utility so having separate read&#x2F;write permissions would be overkill.<p>When Android cloned the same model, they got much more granular with permissions [1][2], but then completely undermined it by making it occur only once at app install. As someone put it [3], they&#x27;re not permissions because you can&#x27;t turn them off -- they&#x27;re warnings about what the app does.

2018-04-04 19:21:07,An Update on Our Plans to Restrict Data Access on Facebook,Are there any companies that rely on Facebook data that are going to face a rough patch (or cease to exist) because of the API changes?,Facebook
2018-04-04 19:14:38,Facebook info of 87M people'improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica',"Two weeks ago we promised to take a hard look at the information apps can use when you connect them to Facebook as well as other data practices. Today, we want to update you on the changes we’re making to better protect your Facebook information. We expect to make more changes over the coming months — and will keep you updated on our progress. Here are the details of the nine most important changes we are making.<p>Events API: Until today, people could grant an app permission to get information about events they host or attend, including private events. This made it easy to add Facebook Events to calendar, ticketing or other apps. But Facebook Events have information about other people’s attendance as well as posts on the event wall, so it’s important that we ensure apps use their access appropriately. Starting today, apps using the API will no longer be able to access the guest list or posts on the event wall. And in the future, only apps we approve that agree to strict requirements will be allowed to use the Events API.<p>Groups API: Currently apps need the permission of a group admin or member to access group content for closed groups, and the permission of an admin for secret groups. These apps help admins do things like easily post and respond to content in their groups. However, there is information about people and conversations in groups that we want to make sure is better protected. Going forward, all third-party apps using the Groups API will need approval from Facebook and an admin to ensure they benefit the group. Apps will no longer be able to access the member list of a group. And we’re also removing personal information, such as names and profile photos, attached to posts or comments that approved apps can access.<p>Pages API: Until today, any app could use the Pages API to read posts or comments from any Page. This let developers create tools for Page owners to help them do things like schedule posts and reply to comments or messages. But it also let apps access more data than necessary. We want to make sure Page information is only available to apps providing useful services to our community. So starting today, all future access to the Pages API will need to be approved by Facebook.<p>Facebook Login: Two weeks ago we announced important changes to Facebook Login. Starting today, Facebook will need to approve all apps that request access to information such as check-ins, likes, photos, posts, videos, events and groups. We started approving these permissions in 2014, but now we’re tightening our review process — requiring these apps to agree to strict requirements before they can access this data. We will also no longer allow apps to ask for access to personal information such as religious or political views, relationship status and details, custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness activity, book reading activity, music listening activity, news reading, video watch activity, and games activity. In the next week, we will remove a developer’s ability to request data people shared with them if it appears they have not used the app in the last 3 months.<p>Instagram Platform API: We’re making the recently announced deprecation of the Instagram Platform API effective today. You can find more information here.<p>Search and Account Recovery: Until today, people could enter another person’s phone number or email address into Facebook search to help find them. This has been especially useful for finding your friends in languages which take more effort to type out a full name, or where many people have the same name. In Bangladesh, for example, this feature makes up 7% of all searches. However, malicious actors have also abused these features to scrape public profile information by submitting phone numbers or email addresses they already have through search and account recovery. Given the scale and sophistication of the activity we’ve seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way. So we have now disabled this feature. We’re also making changes to account recovery to reduce the risk of scraping as well.<p>Call and Text History: Call and text history is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This means we can surface the people you most frequently connect with at the top of your contact list. We’ve reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not collect the content of messages — and will delete all logs older than one year. In the future, the client will only upload to our servers the information needed to offer this feature — not broader data such as the time of calls.<p>Data Providers and Partner Categories: Last week we announced our plans to shut down Partner Categories, a product that lets third-party data providers offer their targeting directly on Facebook.<p>App Controls: Finally, starting on Monday, April 9, we’ll show people a link at the top of their News Feed so they can see what apps they use — and the information they have shared with those apps. People will also be able to remove apps that they no longer want. As part of this process we will also tell people if their information may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.<p>In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people — mostly in the US — may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.<p>Overall, we believe these changes will better protect people’s information while still enabling developers to create useful experiences. We know we have more work to do — and we’ll keep you updated as we make more changes. You can find more details on the platform changes in our Facebook Developer Blog.",Facebook

2018-03-29 01:21:29,"Facebook pauses app reviews, disables new user authorizations","There are, obviously similarities. Yet there are, I believe, also two major differences:<p>(a) This was 8 and 4 years earlier. A lot changed in that timeframe. While, yes, there were always concerns about privacy, the string of data leaks, and the increasingly obvious power of statistical methods for targeting, have had a strong effect on the general public&#x27;s attitude towards the practice.<p>(b) The Obama campaign did not break their contract with Facebook. Facebook did apparently turn of their API limits, either because of sympathy or because that&#x27;s just what they did for big clients back then (FarmVille got the same privilege). But in the end, it appears that nobody broke any rules back then.<p>Now this probably won&#x27;t convince everybody. So let me say this: even if the reaction now is hypocritical, it seems everyone agrees that the current outrage is justified. If so, it would be foolish not take action now just because &quot;your team&quot; got caught while the other got away. After all, the chances of each party being advantaged by such practices going forward seem to be exactly equal.<p>(Not to mention the vastly larger universe of threats not involving the two US parties)",Facebook
2018-03-28 22:52:10,"Facebook pauses app reviews, disables new user authorizations","The Facebook API has been useless since 2014 when most access to friend data was cutoff.  Since then, if your objective was data collection, that could be easily achieved  by scraping publicly available information (many friends lists are public, there are many public posts, etc. - certainly enough to use in aggregate to formulate campaign strategies etc.). I suspect that will be the next “scandal,” since in 2018, people can’t possibly take personal responsibility for the things they post and allow to be public.<p>Ironically, the “scandal” that caused this whole thing is a non-issue. Pre-2014 Facebook apps could collect a lot of information about you and your friends, along with their Facebook user IDs, and that was scary because there was a time when you could simply submit a list of user ID’s that you wanted to show a specific ad to.  But since Facebook advertising cannot be targeted by user ID anymore, and this policy was in place well before the 2016 election, all of that data was essentially useless to any participant in the 2016 election other than for aggregate things like general campaign strategies.  I am intimately familiar with the advertise by ID issue - I was awarded a $2k Facebook bug bounty for spotting an exploit in the Custom Audiences feature that allowed an equivalent version of targeting by ID after they disallowed it.<p>So while it’s possible that Obama used his special access to the entire US social graph to successfully influence his elections, it is impossible for Trump or Hillary to have done it <i>even if they had the data</i> because of the changes in the FB ad platform in between 2012 and 2016.  This entire “scandal” was created and promoted by people that don’t understand, or actively ignored, this concept.  If you ask everyone that has read the recent headlines, including reporters that wrote the stories, I’ll bet 99%+ will tell you that they believe they could be specifically targeted with ads.<p>It would be interesting to see if the executives at any of the media companies that have managed to sell this scandal to the public took unusually large short positions in Facebook stock before releasing the story.  Since the story is effectively fraudulent (it was not possible for the election to have been influenced in the way that the stories imply), I assume that would be securities fraud.",Facebook

Our ape brains are horrible at evaluating tradeoffs of this kind.<p>But the flip side to this is why the CA story has blown up: for once, the consequences— &quot;CA got Trump elected!&quot;— are immediate and graspable, in a way that &quot;Facebook is scraping your text info&quot; is not (even if it&#x27;s probably not true).

2018-03-21 20:37:57,Zuckerberg on Cambridge Analytica situation,"&gt; First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit.<p>I remember the old days of the graph API - there was a whole lot you could do with someone&#x27;s account, and it was common for users, especially non technical users to blindly hit accept on the permissions screens.  If I&#x27;m not mistaken, you could even make a developer account without a verified phone number at the time.<p>I don&#x27;t think banning some of those apps is any kind of consolation really. The API sat like that for years. Anyone with nefarious motives already took what they wanted and ran. What repercussions will they face? The will be banned from Facebook? The apps are probably long gone. There was a time when Facebook apps were at their peak, that fad died off. The data is probably sitting in a database somewhere today. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, Facebook Games could still grab the friend list permission until quite recently.<p>Also what authority does Facebook have to do any kind of audit? How would that audit even work? If someone copies all the data to an external drive and locks it up, what will the audit reveal? &quot;Yep there&#x27;s no data here, pinky swear!&quot;<p>The basic premise of Facebook is flawed. If your private thoughts or photos are posted on a platform where you don&#x27;t control the data, the data is never safe. A good product that serves the user faithfully and takes this into account is probably closer to a decentralized product - maybe something like Mastodon (I haven&#x27;t looked into it in much detail).

It used to be possible to get basically everything about B (name, age, gender, photo, etc), but that all got shut down when Graph API 1.0 was discontinued.

2018-03-19 19:15:35,Facebook has suspended acct of the whistleblower who exposed Cambridge Analytica,"This is hyperbole. He created an app, wrote in the description that it was for academic purposes, and then later amended the description &#x2F; TOS to allow selling of data. Facebook is faulting him because he did not update them on the purpose of the app.<p>There were no systemic barriers in place that Kogan had to circumvent to get access to the data; the Facebook API worked as expected and gave it to him. Regardless of the original “purpose” of the app (a small textarea input you supply to FB), the API would provide the data. The “purpose” of an app does not affect what data is available to it in any meaningful way.<p>The idea that he should have notified Facebook of the changes is laughable; all he had to do is change a few text inputs to update the TOS. The FB platform does not treat an app differently based on its purpose. This is CYA language from FB trying to obfuscate the fact that <i>any and every app</i> has access to this same data, and FB has no control over what happens to the data once an app extracts it. Indeed, much of their business model depends on this premise.<p>Further, the practice of changing terms &#x2F; functionality of an app is a laughably commonplace way of circumventing the nearly non-existent FB platform review process.<p>I have personally seen much worse incidents of FB app abuse in the wild. For example I once reverse engineered a top 10 iOS social app and discovered they were injecting custom JS into the WebView provided by FB to get the ID of all your friends, rather than the top 50 you can see. The app’s FB “app” was classified as a game which gave it the requisite permissions for abuse and even allowed the app to secretly invite all your FB friends to it without you ever knowing.",Facebook

As other vertically integrated solutions take shape, that will also cut into Redux&#x27;s usage. At facebook, this would be Relay, a GraphQL library. A lot of people are excited about using a query language to talk to the server. It makes versioning and supporting multiple generic apps&#x2F;features much simpler. Writing specific web service APIs locks you in if you need to support old client versions, etc. You end up with fetchUserInfo(), fetchUserInfo2(), fetchUserInfo3(), etc to avoid breaking clients.

2018-02-22 03:22:38,Semantic Import Versioning,"This could still become a problem (if each dependency statically bundles its own dependencies) if any of the types are exposed in an API.  For example say there is a Twitch and Facebook SDK that both expose a SetUserProfile(Image) function, and Image is provided by a third library (that is used by both SDKs).<p>If both SDKs use different versions of the Image library, the internals of the Image struct may have changed (maybe they added support for black and white images).  Even though the change may be backwards compatible at a source code level, an Image struct v1.15 wouldn&#x27;t work as an Image struct v1.16 unless it had the same internal private fields (and they were used in the same way).<p>Now, your code that loads an Image from disk can&#x27;t work.  It will either use v1.15 and be compatible with Twitch, or use 1.16 and be compatible with Facebook, but not both.  A shared dependency works around this issue as long as the changes are backwards compatible - in this case Go would see that the minimum required version is v1.16 and both SDKs (and your code) would use that (or a newer version if you list it as a requirement).",Facebook
2018-02-20 19:06:58,Twitter and the Internet War,"I am not a coder by any means, but I am a heavy social media user and know a lot about politics, sociology, psych, organizing, health, comms---and I admit, until I read this thread, I liked this article because it gave me a better reason for all the screw ups, beyond, &quot;The Executives are dithering and have no business skills and social skills.&quot; Or the theory &quot;The Executives do nothing because they don&#x27;t care if women and vulnerable people die.&quot; Which is far more disturbing....it can&#x27;t be true, even if it <i>feels</i> true.
I would give anything if they&#x27;d listen to users who have been around awhile. So few people worked there and also used it at the same time. (And users longingly miss the Fail Whale logo...)
As a user (250,000+ tweets) under a pseudonym, twitter has incredible uses, things Facebook and other platforms didn&#x27;t do, because they were so closed and hard to search. They created echo Chambers, because you could only see people you already knew or were slightly connected too. Or worse, your mom or mother-in-law could find you. Twitter was so open--if I want to discuss philosophy or Japanese food or an MRI result, 24&#x2F;7 I just search and people who love that are there. And pseudonyms had to exist, because thousands of people in real life have the same name. (just like the rest of the Internet back then and yes, now too) They thought people would just post status updates like, hey eating lunch, but we did way way more. They made it 140 chars with 20 chars reserved for names because many people had expensive tiny data plans, but could update by text message; allowing a much wider demographic to use it, and across multiple countries, even low tech ones with limited access. 
The most critical piece tho is that users invented everything good about twitter (Sorry creators--but we did). TW allowed some html symbols, so a user put an @ in front of a user name to reply, and it worked! Users also invented hashtags, the first one was for organizing BarCamp--which was kind of a conference not about alcohol and the original manual RT, and MT for modified tweet, and commenting on top of  someone&#x27;s tweet, or at the end of it and we figured out how to shrink long urls to post links. bit.ly had no purpose til then, and many users became Developers and got full access to the API and we crowdsourced hundreds of changes and ideas, from pictures to videos to emoji to gifs to analytics, to accessible apps for people with vision, hearing, speech issues. All while making lots and lots of jokes.
They didn&#x27;t start out with a heavy respect for pseudonyms, and privacy, and free speech--but TW learned it fast after the Green Iran Revolution, and after many patient users wanted to keep privacy because they had rare diseases, and mental health issues, and parents of kids with autism and speech issues took to it and found each other and felt less alone. It was less complicated than blogging and writing long stories on laptops after events happened. I could do everything from live tweeting a doctor&#x27;s appt to an ER visit and get reactions from friends who could tell me what to ask. 
We still tweet everything from recipes to exact instructions on how to ride a bike, how to organize groups like #occupy to crowd sourcing Flu symptoms and rashes, to who is watching what TV show and how cool it is to watch live sports &quot;together&quot; even for people who can&#x27;t leave the house that night and meet.
Weekly hour long Chats take place under special hashtags like #hcsm for Health Care Social Media or #meded for medical education. (doctors and science fans and academics found twitter and they debate articles, techniques, crowdsource diagnoses)
Police and emergency responders and good Samaritans have used it to (swear to god, it&#x27;s true) befriend people who sound troubled or suicidal and validate their pain and sadness and find them help.
It is to this day, the only platform I know that allows people from many different areas to find like-minded people and to bring together people across multiple subject areas.
Nothing else does it quite the same way. Especially with the ridiculous algorithms other platforms use.",Facebook

2018-01-10 15:40:49,Buffett Says Cryptocurrencies Are Certain to Come to a Bad Ending,"Cryptocurrency is currently in the silly phase of bubble. It looks exactly like the peak of dot.com mania. A crash is coming fairly soon. My top end estimate for time remaining would be a year, but I&#x27;d warn anyone contemplating a shorting strategy that bubbles have a way of going far higher than anyone can predict. Many people lost serious money trying to short dot.com and housing. Still we are definitely in the fragile tail end and the crash could come literally any second now.<p>I lived through dot.com and housing mania and I&#x27;m having serious deja moo right now. Deja moo is when you&#x27;ve seen this bull before. On a recent flight I saw a long format in-flight advertising video for DASH, an altcoin. I repeat: <i>airline advertisements!</i> If you still have doubts that we are in gibbering flapdoodle land, head over to YouTube:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hXRhIXp4idM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hXRhIXp4idM</a><p>We have <i>celebrity endorsements</i> and <i>music videos</i>. Run away.<p>I think the crash is going to look a lot like a bank run. There will be some piece of news that triggers it (exchange collapse, policy change, who knows) and then everyone will scramble to cash out. It will quickly become obvious that there is insufficient USD&#x2F;EUR&#x2F;etc. on hand to actually back the current market cap of the top ten coins. At that point exchanges will halt trading. Lawsuits will be filed. Exchanges will go into receivership. More lawsuits will be filed. Criminal charges may start getting filed. You get the picture.<p>Most of the crime and financial fraud that will happen in this bubble is happening now or will happen during the crash itself. Most financial fraud is driven by frantic attempts to cover one&#x27;s ass. My guess is that top people at all the exchanges know they are in serious trouble and there are many frantic meetings going on debating what can possibly be done. Since a bubble is basically a naturally occurring emergent Ponzi scheme, the only way &quot;out&quot; is to get more dumb money in so smart money can exit... hence the airline advertisements and Facebook ads to buy coins. I am currently seeing a <i>lot</i> of the latter.<p>Sadly a lot of naive people will lose tons of money. People have been dumping their life savings and mortgaging their houses to get into this. It could have follow-on effects on the economy. Some of the big Bitcoin exchanges are privately insured, so I wonder if it could drag down a few insurance companies. The rest of the economy is fragile so it&#x27;s not impossible that this could trigger a recession.<p>Cryptocurrency will not go away post-crash any more than the Internet went away post dot.com crash. We&#x27;re just approaching the irrational exuberance peak of the new technology adoption hype cycle.<p>After the crash it will go back to being a semi-underground niche thing for a while. Valuations will return to sanity. Those exchanges and other businesses that do survive will gain a lot of experience and a reputation for stability. Ironically sometimes the best technical work gets done post-crash, so I wonder if after the crash we will finally see useful applications built on this tech beyond its core currency use case.<p>If you really believe in the long term promise of this technology, after the crash would be the time to buy in.<p>P.S.<p>I really wish high schools would teach a class on finance, and if they did it should include a lesson on bubbles and a study of a few recent ones like dot.com and housing. People should be educated about what a bubble looks like and how to avoid getting ruined by one.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t stop everyone. The allure of herd behavior and gambling is strong.

The content industry fought against it, but developers came up with decentralized solutions like DHTs or supernodes.<p>I was convinced the next step would be friend-of-a-friend sharing. You only share files with your direct friends. But they can pass on these files automatically, so their friends can get the files, too. The friends of your friend don&#x27;t know that the file is originally coming from you, it is completely transparent. The goal is to not let anybody you don&#x27;t trust know what you are down- or uploading.<p>I would piggyback on the social graph of existing networks to get started. I actually had a prototype of the friend discovery code, based on XMPP (using custom stanzas). You login with your credentials, and it shows you all your friends that are using the same app. It worked with GTalk, Facebook Messenger, and Skype (via Skype API). One nice feature was that this worked without getting an API key from Facebook etc., or having a central server. I was so pissed when they all changed their APIs to make this impossible.

That’s why building an API was such a key early change of what Facebook was.<p>Typically, Twitter does something similar to Facebook on the surface (a news feed) but is not planning on serving as an authentication layer, so they do a lot less to address grievers, inauthentic accounts and lately, unwanted political influence.<p>The News Feed was the first key feature, built internally and it boosted the business model that Facebook has started leveraging: targeted advertising. But neither the News Feed, not advertising is the core of Facebook — no more than ads are at the core of Google.<p>Google wants to leverage artificial intelligence to organise the world’s information.

2017-09-13 11:28:52,Better Database Migrations in Postgres,"At Facebook we discovered this is especially important for large sharded environments. As you add more shards, the chances that a migration will fail on at least one of them (simply due to hardware failure) increases. A declarative approach, where you have a repo of CREATE statements that your tools can diff&#x2F;sync automatically, is much easier to manage. You can have automation just retry in a loop until the shard converges on the desired final state.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve been looking for something similar for Postgres and MySQL&#x2F;MariaDB without any luck<p>For MySQL, I wrote an open source tool to do this: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skeema&#x2F;skeema"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skeema&#x2F;skeema</a> -- it gives you a repo-of-CREATE-statements approach to schema management, like you describe.<p>Skeema&#x27;s CLI is inspired by Git (in terms of paradigm for subcommands) and the MySQL client (in terms of option-handling), so if you know how to use those tools, it&#x27;s a cinch to learn. Basically you `skeema init` to initially populate your CREATE statements (one file per table) from a db instance. You can then change those files locally and run `skeema diff` to view auto-generated DDL, or `skeema push` to actually execute it. Or if you make &quot;out of band&quot; changes directly to the db -- such as renames, or just someone doing something manually for whatever reason -- then you can `skeema pull` to update the files accordingly.<p>Skeema&#x27;s configuration supports online schema change tools, service discovery, sharding, various safety options, etc. I also hope to add integration with GitHub API at some point. That can provide a really nice &quot;self service&quot; model for schema management at scale.",Facebook
2017-09-02 05:21:34,My first fifteen compilers,"I&#x27;d strongly suggest diving into compilers if you&#x27;ve never studied the subject. Learning a bit on the subject unlocks a ton of incredibly useful skills. That knowledge helps you implement stuff like autocomplete, linters, syntax highlighting, etc.<p>The Super Tiny Compiler [0] is a very gentle introduction to the subject. It&#x27;s great because it helps you quickly develop an initial mental model.<p>To give an everyday usage example: I&#x27;ve used jscodeshift [1] many times to safely refactor large amounts of code. In one case, I quickly migrated a project&#x27;s test assertion library to an alternative which the team agreed was superior. This tool is also typically used by the react team in order to provide a smooth migration path whenever they make changes to the public API.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thejameskyle&#x2F;the-super-tiny-compiler"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thejameskyle&#x2F;the-super-tiny-compiler</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;jscodeshift"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;jscodeshift</a>",Facebook

That <i>is</i> changing, since there are only three &quot;blessed&quot; mobile payment systems now in Samsung, Android, and Apple Pay (rather than what we should have, a standard mobile payment API handled by ISO).

If the advertisers Google is trying to bully fight back by having their affiliates block Chrome, either those businesses die or Chrome loses market share. We will have to see what happens, but I generally think if consumers <i>want</i> to use a web product, they would get another browser to do so and <i>stop using Chrome</i> in the same way we got 40% of people to drop IE for Firefox.<p>And finally, Google also doesn&#x27;t have any agreements with Amazon. That is why you have to manually download their app store APK, and why it doesn&#x27;t have first class installation support as a generic app like the Play Store. But Amazon is also making their own Android devices <i>without</i> Gapps, and Samsung is in a position to at least <i>try</i> it themselves if they wanted to, since they have their own app suite as well. And all Google does is require that <i>all</i> their apps be installed if a manufacturer wants to include any of them - which while heavy handed isn&#x27;t anticompetitive to do.<p>If anything, a real domain of monopoly exploit by Google is how they will punish companies they disagree with in SEO, when they <i>do</i> have an overwhelming majority of the search market, and it has been proven in the last 2 decades of business that consumers treat Google like gospel - if its not there, it might as well not exist. People don&#x27;t try using alternative search engines if they don&#x27;t find what they are looking for on Google.<p>&gt; Android is an example of an inferior product succeeding through monopoly control.<p>Android is first mover advantage. It has the same vicious feedback loop that gives Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc their monopolies - they act as middle men to third party products and services, and by capturing the audience capture the mindshare of retailers. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its user and app developers, users and websites, users and friends of them, or users and actual goods retailers - each one has dominance in their market because they have the mindshare.<p>I don&#x27;t see how Google is being particularly abusive with how they run Android. Nobody <i>has to</i> use their Play Store, and nobody <i>has to</i> develop against the Play Services thus bonding their app to the Google Suite. It is just consumers <i>want</i> the apps on <i>that</i> store, so developers use the services and ignore the competition and create a self fulfilling prophecy of monopoly.<p>And I&#x27;m not arguing Android doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly - just Google isn&#x27;t really exploiting it by only requiring all their apps come if someone wants the Play Store. The OS itself is liberally licensed, and anyone could either reuse Dalvik or write their own implementation to run APKs.

2017-06-05 10:52:12,Ask HN: Why Use Social Media Logins?,"As a &quot;user&quot;, I love logging in with social media. How awesome is it that I can just click a button and be logged in instantly? No worrying about setting up a password, at least, for most websites. I used to not trust it, but after becoming a developer and learning: it is just grabbing an email or a name is not too bad. Though sometimes, it may grab more than that, such as your friends list, etc. Somehow, that became okay and no one cares.<p>As a &quot;developer&quot;, things are quite different. There are a few libraries of code on Github and you can find examples across the Internet. For the most part, these examples do work after you have set up some API backend on the social media platforms themselves.<p>Code would almost seem straightforward. However, it is not always the case, especially, when a social media platform is ever-changing.  For example, last week, someone released a new product on Hacker News and went about his way, only to realize, that people were attempting to login to Facebook, which recently upgraded from SDK 4 to SDK 5. Massive changes occurred. How embarrassing to go live, only for one of your social media buttons not to work? It&#x27;s not his fault, but it&#x27;s Facebook who updated their code so older versions no longer work. Most developers are trying to focus on their own code and make sure it works. Now they have to worry about potential users being unable to access the front door?<p>When I went to update Facebook SDK 4 to SDK 5 on one of my own platforms, using Facebook&#x27;s very example that they provided. I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I ended up removing Facebook from my registration and login screen. The three that remained were Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn.<p>After some careful testing with these three, they work for the most part, except occasionally, if someone logs into Google, and then tries to login again real fast, such as your code not remembering them and keeping them logged in, Google&#x27;s token expires and it won&#x27;t auto-generate a new one, and it creates a problem, an error that you can&#x27;t even catch, so your users are exposed to seeing that error.<p>Twitter, too, seems to have some issues. Using the examples you can easily find on the Internet, and I&#x27;m no genius when it comes to this stuff, but I managed to copy some code, put it together, and make it work with my database, this would also come with problems: It keeps looping and acquiring a new oauth token without ever going back to my website with the information.  After spending nearly an hour trying to figure out what the problem was and scouring the Internet with very few answers, I gave up. So Twitter has now been removed.<p>LinkedIn is my last resort, but to offer only one option: is it better at all?<p>The purpose of social media logins was to making logging in easier, but none of these social media platforms have beginner or even novice developers in mind. If any of the code was to change while your web application is live, than you are screwed, trying to come up with a patch for it. Lest, you might not even find out until someone actually reports it that your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google login isn&#x27;t working. How would you know otherwise, since you probably might only use one or none?<p>I sought to find out: Do we really need to use social media logins? In this day and age, it is supposedly expected. For the most part, researching claims, there is a 60% usage of social media login buttons. But are they necessary? I came across another article from a developer at MailChimp which makes a great point about social logins: while people use them, if people like your application or find it useful, they are going to register and login with a username or email address, regardless of whether you have social media or not.<p>Here is the article: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2F;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2F;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-...</a><p>Navigating to MailChimp&#x27;s registration and login page: there is no social media presence.<p>So I know there are some attempts at making life easier for developers out there, such as Hybridauth Social Login PHP Library ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hybridauth.github.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hybridauth.github.io&#x2F;</a> ), which may do a good job, but I&#x27;ve not used it yet.  There are also other non-free solutions out there in which you pay for a script or a web company to handle it all for you. This too, might be good, but why? Why isn&#x27;t it easier for developers to set up social media buttons?<p>Maybe it is security concerns or whatever, but you would think that as large as these social media platforms are, they&#x27;d be better at giving you the email and username or whatever you need.. and making it easier. After all, it is technically free branding for them that you put on your website.<p>Anyone else struggle with social media login or just give up completely or maybe you found a really easy solution that grants you peace of mind?",Facebook

It&#x27;s worth pointing out the authors released codemods which will likely be able to convert your app from one version of the library to the next as long as you don&#x27;t do something exceptionally clever.<p>The changes between 0.x and v1 were entirely expected. It seems the authors followed the common semantics that 0.x releases are considered experimental, v1 was based on the lessons learned. v2 and v3 then improved upon that design with relatively minor changes.<p>On the other hand v4 is an entirely new library using an entirely different paradigm: routes use component semantics and are part of the component structure, rather than just some JS router that uses JSX syntax for aesthetics.<p>But as I said: v3 is still being actively maintained, the authors have just decided that the v4 API fits React better. And for all major releases from v1 to v3 you should be able to upgrade practically for free by using codemods.<p>I think the importance of codemods can not be understated though many people are still ignorant of them: Facebook releases codemods for every major version of React and uses them internally to upgrade their tens of thousands of components automatically. Third-party libraries like React Router have also started providing them.<p>Codemods written well should allow app developers to migrate breaking API changes in dependencies with practically no development effort.<p>Additionally, like React, React Router seems to have adopted the approach of deprecating APIs in the final release of a major version that is no longer going to be supported so you can upgrade your manually code before moving to the new major version with no fear of things breaking. So when upgrading from v2 to v3 you should be able to upgrade safely by simply upgrading to the latest minor version and fixing any deprecation warnings.<p>Both codemods as well as deprecations of course assume you&#x27;re doing the sensible thing and a) upgrading one major version at a time and b) actually maintaining your project rather than just spending half an hour on it once a year to implement a new feature with no test coverage.<p>Personally I often end up doing the not so sensible thing where I end up having to migrate all third party deps to the latest version once a year or two, but libraries like React and React Router are the least of my worries because they are extremely safe and easy to upgrade -- even to the point where there&#x27;s no need to upgrade beyond React Router v3 unless you also prefer the v4 API.",Facebook

2017-05-16 10:12:09,Simple Web Developer Checklist,"I&#x27;m going to go the other way on the SQL advice, even though the author has clarified below that he was talking about prepared statements.<p>It doesn&#x27;t cost me much, if any, developer time to work with stored procedures. I realize most full stack devs don&#x27;t have as much in-depth experience with SQL. That was literally all I did for the first several years of my career. Before it ever occurred to me to learn other programming languages and. It was pure SQL all day every day.<p>If you have the resources to implement even half of this checklist, you probably have the resources to go whole hog on stored procs.<p>I sometimes do this, and sometimes don&#x27;t. Partly, it&#x27;s because I need to stay current with ORMs for the sake of potential job opportunities. And partially because it can be more convenient to keep my head in one language for fleshing out an idea. But for serious projects, I&#x27;ll go the stored proc route.<p>In that kind of scenario, I think of the database as a type of microservice that&#x27;s completely separate from the application layer. You write in the most performant language for that service, even if it&#x27;s different for the main language the app is written in. And you reap the benefits of the database optimizing the procs as well as the database handling transactions instead of trying to manage that in your application.<p>How much of a burden this is boils down to whether you personally have the chops (or someone on the team does), and if you get your shit together when it comes to deployment. Stored Proc code should be saved in text files under version control, and your deploy process should make updates to the procs automatically.<p>If you do things this way, it&#x27;s not any more painful than versioning your database with migrations, which I do on every project, no matter how small. Using stored procs doesn&#x27;t have to mean you&#x27;re working with a mess of unmanageable database code. You can use SQL Alchemy to create models and relationships, Alembic (just speaking to the Python world here), and use a thin wrapper around executing the stored proc, and it&#x27;s really not that much different from writing prepared statements in Alchemy.<p>In principle, it&#x27;s really not different from writing a web app that provides an API that your front end hits (a Python app that resents REST for Angular to call or something else equally common). In this case, I&#x27;m just pushing the API down one layer in the stack.<p>People can argue that the logic that applies to the data should be kept with the logic that defines the data--i.e., that if your model defines the shape of the date, your code that defines its behavior should reside there as well: in the model definition. So the ORM is the correct place for that. Methods on the Class object. I&#x27;m sympathetic to that argument, but I also disagree with it, sort of.<p>I think the rules that govern the behavior of data should exist where the data exists rather than any abstraction layer. Otherwise you have to rewrite them for every new thing that wants to access the data.<p>And every useful application that people use involving data is going to serve that data to more than the first application you designed to work with it. Keeping these rules in sync across even a very minimal web app that consists only of the app itself, an API, and an analytics platform is already some overhead.<p><i>And</i>, every data-driven application already has two means of interface regardless of whether you intend that or not: direct database manipulation. That is going to happen sometimes, whether you want it or not or how bad a practice it is. If there are rules about how things should behave (there are always rules about how things should behave) you have to enforce them at the database level.<p>If you&#x27;re doing that correctly already, there&#x27;s really not that much overhead in using stored procedures. Going that route means that every connection to a database for a certain dataset means that there is a single source of truth for that dataset. Execute procedure x to get data y. That&#x27;s all any developer on any service needs to know.<p>It also makes the idea of minimum privilege easier to manage. You don&#x27;t have to grant select on a table for the API user, for example. You can grant execute to the set of procs that user needs, and only those procs are accessible. Combine that with some well-thought views, and you can greatly limit your attack surface. If someone breaches part of your system and manages to obtain so source code, they don&#x27;t get any real information about the structure of your database. They only get conn.execute(&#x27;check_valid_user&#x27;) or whatever.<p>The obvious problem here is versioning APIs. Which you must always do. So you have to version your stored procs when there are breaking changes. But the overhead in adding a _v1 or _v1.1 to the end of an .sql file for a proc really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal compared to all the other stuff you have to do when maintaining an API.<p>Again, I&#x27;m sympathetic to objections to this model. It is not perfect, and I&#x27;ve never once tried to inflict it on coworkers who want to do things differently. I&#x27;ll do this in my own projects, and when I&#x27;ve gone into a company that&#x27;s already working with that mindset. I don&#x27;t hold up the train based on philosophical differences.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of criticism I agree with that SOA is not a good place to start. It carries a lot of overhead, and you shouldn&#x27;t go there until you need to. But to me, the reality is that any web app that comprises a data store, a controller layer, and a front end is already by definition SOA--not the monolith that you want to think of it as. And therefore you should treat it as such and give the various components the attention they deserve.<p>If you&#x27;re working on a project you have reasonable expectation will be used enough to require some scaling, this is a totally acceptable way to do things. Let the database do what it&#x27;s best at, let the controller layer do what it&#x27;s best at, and then use the front end that&#x27;s best for your use case.<p>Because this response isn&#x27;t long enough already, I&#x27;ll just add this. I don&#x27;t think the MVC model is really appropriate for web apps. Even the modified MVVC model is still weird to me. It seems like a model we shoehorned onto what a web app really is. To me, the web app model is data, logic, presentation. The data layer comprises both the data and the rules about the data. The logic layer dictates what happens when an event is triggered by the presentation layer. And it should be relatively thin, particularly when working with one of the slower languages like Python or Ruby. The presentation layer simply defines the user interface and sends messages to the logic layer.<p>These things really are decoupled by nature in ways they aren&#x27;t necessarily in native or desktop apps or mobile apps. I think that web developers need to understand that this model really doesn&#x27;t fit very well. And behave accordingly.<p>There are obviously exceptions to everything I&#x27;m saying here. But the exceptions come at very large scales. Most apps that start out as MVC web apps on whatever stack are not going to become Facebook or Reddit and are not going to have the specific problems that come with that level of scale.<p>Even so, I would encourage people to rethink what web apps are, and what the MVC&#x2F;MVVC model really means. I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right model, and the decisions we make about architecture are generally not good ones.<p>Finally, since this is so long now, I want to point out that I didn&#x27;t generate these ideas all on my own. I&#x27;ve been heavily influenced by Lex de Haan and Toon Kopplaars in their book, <i>Applied Mathematics for Database Professionals</i>.",Facebook

But it&#x27;s still garbage.<p>I was one of the first users of the beta program. At the time, Ludvig&#x27;s philosophy of simplicity + hidden functionality via interactive views shone through the UI and it was very pleasant to use. The 5 star rating system was the icing on the cake. A step down in functionality from Amarok&#x27;s playlist creation system, and lacking the fine search and organization capabilities of foobar2000, but it did the job.<p>However, the UX of Spotify has hideously morphed over time. Now the UI mostly uses Chromium Embedded Framework which brings huge overhead and causes lots of rendering latency. The font size and padding has grown, then shrunk, then grown again, each time showing less tracks on a page at once. Views that were once interactive with left and right clicks became static. Star ratings turned into Like&#x2F;Unlike.<p>Their user behavior tracking has naturally been cranked up to 11, though it is better than a lot of similar products, I still have no desire for a music service to track anything other than the music I search and play. Even tracking the song titles in my personal library is an unacceptable breach of privacy.<p>The slow and steady social creep and tracking through Facebook is also unacceptable.<p>It doesn&#x27;t utilize P2P anymore, which I considered a plus because I love supporting and legitimizing P2P tech.<p>It has become less of an engineer-led company and more of a traditional company with shareholder interests<p>I could really go on. The downsides of Spotify <i>as a music player</i> are much greater than they were at product launch.<p>The most infuriating thing about it is that Spotify never fielded these changes with users before committing to them, and each and every time when a simple addition to the settings panel could make the changes optional, they were instead forced upon us.<p>I don&#x27;t like a music player that frequently changes its UI without my approval. I like a music player that puts <i>me</i> in charge of the UI.<p>I no longer pay for Spotify and have returned to getting my music through other means.<p>On my Linux and Windows machines, I mostly use foobar2000 and VLC, and Amarok when I need powerful playlisting tools. If Radionomy ever gets their shit straight with Winamp (They bought it from AOL in &#x27;14 and have to clean out all proprietary code) then I will definitely consider going back.<p>Give me a streaming service that doesn&#x27;t spy on me unnecessarily and has an API so that I can implement a plugin to my favorite existing media player or otherwise an absolutely beautiful and immutable interface, and of course a large library and doesn&#x27;t shaft its artists, and I will pay for it.

2017-05-09 15:25:18,The tragedy of 100% code coverage (2016),"You really shouldn&#x27;t, or if you do it should be an extreme minority of tests and automated tests should do the heavy lifting.<p>Automated tests can do so much more than manual tests that shops still living by manual tests either have a damn good reason or are just as wrong as people who argued against Revision Control Systems (or people who argued for gotos instead of functions).<p>Automated tests will be executed identically each time, so no missing test cases because someone slacked off or made a typo. Automated test can serve as examples for how to use the code. Automated tests can aid in porting to new platforms, once it builds you can find all the bugs your care about swiftly. Automated test can be integrated with documentation, tools like doxyegn and mdbook make this easier.<p>Automated tests enable Continuous Integration. Are you familiar with Travis CI or Jenkins? If not, imagine a computer that a team commits their code to, instead of directly to the mainline Revision Control (Git master, svn head, etc...). That computer builds the software, runs all the tests, perhaps on every supported platform or in an environment very close to production, then only merges commits that appear to fully work. This doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate bugs and broken builds, but the change is so large that teams without it are at a clear competitive disadvantage.<p>When integrated into process tests can be used to protect code from changes. If a test exercises an API and the team knows that is the purpose then when they change things in a way that break the test they shouldn&#x27;t... This sounds vague or obvious, but consider this: At Facebook and Google they have a rule that if it is not tested new code doesn&#x27;t have to care if it breaks. Both companies have team that make broad Sweeping changes. Facebook wrote a new std::string and Google use clangtools to make automated changes in thousands of places at once.

2017-04-22 18:20:59,An experienced Javascript developer’s account of learning React,"This post is misleading throughout.<p>The article shows snippets from the Redux and React Router docs, implying they are realistic examples of the way that typical React code should look, however, they are clearly snippets which are trying to show the entirety of an API on one screen. If your code is just a bunch of snippets copy-pasted from docs without much thought given to the structure of your code, your choice of UI library isn&#x27;t the problem.<p>On React Router, React Router is not React. You don&#x27;t need to use React Router. There are plenty of stable pure JS routing libraries, which don&#x27;t release new versions often (or ever, because they are &#x27;done&#x27;). Nothing about React requires you to use a React-related routing library.<p>The author found Redux and MobX too complex for their use case. However, Redux and MobX are not required to use React (there seems to be a theme here), and probably not useful if you don&#x27;t have a big single page app with a lot of client side state. Implying they are intrinsic aspects of using React is wrong.<p>The bits at the end:<p><i>you will need to import in your scripts react-dom and react without never using the last one instance for some wild reason known only by the React team</i><p>The react and react-dom packages are being split so react-native doesn&#x27;t have to pull in dependencies which are only used on the web.

2017-02-22 15:59:49,"Google Site Search will be completely shut down by April 1, 2018","Last couple of years or so have been an eye opener for me on how I choose libraries, tools and services for my project. One important lesson was that never choose a service which don&#x27;t have plug and play open source alternative. Even hyped start ups go out of business and big companies like Facebook and Google shut down services.<p>Third party APIs are a even bigger risk. Facebook and Twitter APIs used to change quite often 2-3 years ago. (Haven&#x27;t personally worked on this off late though.) APIs and services which seem too cheap are generally the ones which should be avoided. Because it is more likely that the companies running these will not find a sustainable business model.<p>Even Open Source projects get abandoned quite often. Sometimes a team puts together an impressive open source project and then they get acquired by a big company which results in abandonment of the project. I have one client who has his startup riding on Kurento Media Server for WebRTC calls. This product is in development from last one and half years. Now, after Kurento&#x27;s acquisition by Twilio, Kurento&#x27;s future is not clear. Also it&#x27;s not a project which any body can just get into and start developing it further. Thankfully Kurento is not abandoned yet by the development team, but I had read somewhere that they are looking for new maintainers.<p>The lesson learned is only depend on mature open source projects and depend on PaaS services which make those open source projects available as easy to use services. Even if that PaaS service go down, there is a high chance that you will find someone who can deploy and support it for you.<p>However, if you are depending on a third party API or a relatively unknown Open Source Project for critical functionality, treat it as a big risk in your product&#x27;s future road map and be prepared with a contingency plan.<p>Right now in cloud services there are way too many products which are not easily replaceable. But these are easy to use and sometimes solve really difficult problems. So the temptation to use them is too high.

As someone who works in computer vision etc, I was convinced though that good tracking would be many years out, and then suddenly there were the lighthouse solution from Valve. Now I&#x27;ve had the same thought about inside-out tracking (by means of vision), but even that seems to be arriving much faster than I initially anticipated. Today every big tech company from MS, Google, Facebook, to Valve, and hardware companies such as Samsung, HTC and Nvidia&#x2F;ATI manufacturers are pushing hard on every frontier of VR.

Then, you choose a filter, tune the filter, and after some processing, your result is ready.<p>- The finished image can be saved on the device, or exported directly to Instagram or Facebook.<p>- Recently, their camera gained a new button, to livestream to Facebook instead. The filters can be changed at any time during the broadcast.<p>- Facebook has revoked their API access to this livestream feature.<p>- Facebook is indeed working on style transfer for live video [1].<p>So this wasn&#x27;t the case of a third-party app <i>depending</i> on a big platform&#x27;s APIs and playing within their own walled garden. Rather, it&#x27;s a related, but different case of betting on the tech instead of the community [2], effectively being a free tech demo and hoping to attract investor interest.<p>While this may still work, the concept was quickly copied, -- in some cases, deliberately, like in the case of VK&#x27;s Vinci [3].

2016-11-15 09:15:51,Do you really want an SPA framework?,"You don’t need any of this stuff to build a great web app. You don’t need react, you don’t need fancy javascript syntax that requires you have a complicated build infrastructure. Babel has over 40,000 files. Think about that for a moment. 40k files for some shorthand syntax. Your &quot;build&quot; times may only be a few seconds now (anything that is over one second imo is too long), but just wait. They will get to 30+ seconds in no time and then you&#x27;ll have to go dive into the belly of that 40k file beast to find out how to unfuck yourself. I&#x27;ve been there.<p>You don’t even need a framework most of the time. Most of the frameworks I’ve used are poorly designed (I&#x27;m looking at you Ember. If there are any Ember devs reading this, I&#x27;ll meet you in the parking lot...) and represent the design choices of a someone working on some project probably a lot different than yours. It feels good to give up control and let someone else make some choices for you, until you realize you’ve built an application based upon their poor design, and then you’re stuck.<p>All you need is semantic HTML, the DOM, and some plain old javascript. Organize your code, write simply, don’t overcomplicate and try to make things too general because your problems probably are very likely concrete anyway. Don’t buy into the hype. Just because big company X uses something, doesn’t mean you need to use it on your projects too. Have you seen Facebook? Their product hasn’t changed or innovated appreciably in years so you shouldn’t be taking any lessons from them in how to build ‘scalable’ applications, whatever that means.<p>Don’t dump a 500 KB framework on the page to save a few milliseconds in incremental rendering. Or think you need to worry about performance or complexity before you even have an app.<p>Is it odd to anyone that the entire battle cry of React is rooted in pre-optimization? The myth that the DOM is somehow evil, or all pages will one day have millions of elements to manage? This is gladly spoonfed to people who don&#x27;t understand how the browser works, and never learned the basics. Take away their framework and they don&#x27;t know how to build apps!<p>It violates my sense of pragmatism to save a few ms in rendering when you delay the initial page load by 500 ms or more? I also personally find the mixing of declarative and imperative programming styles and JSX to be absolutely horrid and the debug experience of many of the immutable libraries to be terrible. And, if you actually performance test the stuff you&#x27;ll see they are full of either outright lies or fabrications to make the authors look good. Hint: if every time you call a getter on an object it causes the framework to go 30 stacks deep you&#x27;re not going to have good performance. Just try it in your framework of choice today. You&#x27;re swear we&#x27;re working in java these days with the stack traces so deep and abstracted they have lost all touch with reality.<p>My favorite recently is to find all kinds of bizarre wrappers for javascript libraries that could have been used well enough on their own. The wrappers don&#x27;t really do anything other than hard-code the original author&#x27;s API and basically act as a middle man. I guess everything needs to be wrapped in a react component to be useful these days huh?",Facebook

Did that for about a year or two before I got my Nexus 5. At least buying new batteries gave me back my battery life that had degraded to almost nothing over the years.<p>On top of that, over the years, the kickstand broke, the screen got scratched badly, my belt clip broke in multiple places, the SIM slot became really finicky, and even the plastic around the keyboard was starting to come out.<p>And a lot of the problem was performance: a 600 MHz OMAP3 was great in 2009, but by 2014 it was just too slow to handle modern websites, and the browser based on Firefox 3.5 (maybe 3.6?) couldn&#x27;t even handle some newer websites. And to be honest, the RAM was low even for its time... only 256 MB, operated as a unionfs with the rootfs, plus some of the (very, very slow) eMMC was formatted as swap. Over time, most apps stopped working: I remember using Facebrick to access Facebook for a while, and it was nice, but eventually the author stopped updating it, and Facebook changed their API, so no more Facebrick. It got to the point where I&#x27;d only use the browser, terminal, camera, and dialer, because that&#x27;s all that was useful.<p>About a year after getting my Nexus 5, I booted up my N900 to get some photos off it, and I found I had difficulty emailing them to myself because Gmail had changed their API and flagged my N900&#x27;s connection attempts because they used the old API that was deprecated for security reasons.

2016-10-30 07:12:19,Is Vue.js easier for a beginner to learn than jQuery?,"I get the feeling that React with the Redux&#x2F;Flux architecture scales to Facebook-level complexity a bit better than Vue. Vue feels kinda like if you made plain React with setState a lot easier to use.<p>The complete separation of presentation and state with flux is a lot of work but starts to pay off when your data is used in many places and you can just connect any piece to the same global state and keep consistency. Or when you can make writing API interactions really easy with one middleware and from there your requests are done declaratively with actions.<p>I wonder what it&#x27;s like to use Vue with Redux! Probably a bit weird given the two-way binding, where Redux is all about one-way binding and cycling every change through a global state transition. At first glance (revue, vue-redux) this seems awkward.<p>How does your team accomplish the stuff you would otherwise do with Redux? How do you do AJAX and how do you propagate that around?

I am sure lots of apps need these things, but for web storefronts a lot of this seems like overkill. Shopify also supercharges you when you want to move beyond just a web storefront: we have a mobile SDK for building native apps, connectors to let you sell on Amazon, Facebook, and anywhere you can inject HTML, a world class mobile administration app, a POS solution, a massive app store for other integrations, etc etc etc.<p>&gt; this is usually not an indicator for scalability and a low-latency design<p>Again, sub 100ms response time and an order of magnitude more traffic every minute than the peak the Thinks sale saw... that&#x27;s pretty good!<p>I&#x27;m trying to get at the fact that building a web store from scratch, be it with a handy backend as a service or not, is going to be really hard in comparison to using Shopify.

There is nothing fundamentally different in new frameworks (heck, most are them are just rehashes of others that are many years old with very small improvements), but suddenly the echo chamber makes it out to be vital to your career.<p>Like React. It&#x27;s nice but come on... Every frontend programmer I know is fretting that they are not into it enough because you will die or something if you are not. That seems good marketing by Facebook to get such a solid drive behind it so quickly.

It would make you stressed if think you feel you have to keep up with all of that.<p>Also, some tools seem to have just been made to look smart.

And if you want wildcards or a &gt;90 day length (regardless of what you think of their security, many people do -- the biggest sites on the internet have both), that means paying money. And it also still leaves you vulnerable to MitM rogue CA attacks.<p>HPKP requires the user to connect the first time to get the pinned key. If an MitM has a fake certificate for your domain, they can send that to you on your first connection and fool you. DANE does not have this problem.<p>Well, to be fair, DANE has it for the DNSSEC provider used. But that is one thing to trust, and said certificate can be bundled with the OS or browser. One thing to trust beats the current 2000+ intermediate CAs we have to trust.<p>Further, DANE allows a way to verify self-signed certificates, allowing security to be free for everyone. We could see a lot more innovation than just certbot if Let&#x27;s Encrypt weren&#x27;t the only way to generate free certificates. For just one example, web servers could generate certificates from fresh installs; zero configuration requied. Like Caddy, but in nginx and Apache.<p>Lastly, HPKP is riskier. You have to include a backup pin. But, what would happen if your had your own pinned, and StartSSL as the secondary? And you set HPKP for a year? And two weeks from now, Mozilla revokes StartCom entirely? Well, good luck with that one. Deleting HPKP is a royal pain for a regular user (about:permissions in Firefox, chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;net-internals#hsts in Chrome)<p>&gt; We also have pre-loaded pinning in Chrome for larger or more obvious targets.<p>Nice for Google and Facebook, not so nice for byuu.org =(<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also worth noting that CryptoCat has committed pinning-suicide in Chrome at at the moment due to their CA having switched intermediates between renewals.<p>Another good negative of HPKP.<p>&gt; But support for that was removed because it was a bunch of parsing code outside of the sandbox, wasn&#x27;t really being used and it conflicted with two long-term plans for the health of the HTTPS ecosystem: eliminating 1024-bit RSA and Certificate Transparency. The conflicts are probably the most important reasons for not wanting to renew the experiment.<p>RSA-1024 is bad, yes. Perhaps we should start asking how we can get DNSSEC on RSA-2048+. Having a commitment to implement it in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari if we do would go a long way toward making that happen, I&#x27;m sure. Further, we can reject any RSA-1024 signed DNSSEC after that point, just like we reject weak crypto in browsers today.<p>If they can&#x27;t change DNSSEC to stronger crypto, how about they make an alternative? If Google introduces one that has stronger crypto, supports it in Chrome, and offers a free &quot;DNSSEC+&quot; hosting service, I&#x27;ll definitely take immediate advantage of that.<p>But the latter is the whole point of DANE -- self-signing. Certificate Transparency is a crutch due to the CA system having 2000+ intermediate CAs that can sign any domain name they want. With DANE, you don&#x27;t need that anymore. DANE is about providing an alternative to the CA signing business.<p>And there&#x27;s nothing stopping users from serving up trusted CA-signed endpoint certificate signatures over DANE&#x2F;TLSA records. That would obviously remain the only sensible way to do EV certificates. The way I see it, a DANE certificate would act like HTTP does now: you get the globe (or even the question mark circle), but your page actually loads over HTTPS, instead of sending you to Defcon-1 advisories that are all but impossible for the casual user to work around (and indeed, we don&#x27;t want to train them to work around these warnings anyway.) There&#x27;s no way this would be <i>worse</i> than plain-text HTTP.<p>&gt; You literally can&#x27;t avoid it because the root zone transits through a 1024-bit key.<p>Does this really matter for the root? There are root CAs with RSA-1024 still.<p>...<p>At any rate, Google apparently feels DNSSEC+DANE is good enough for this web service API. So, honest question, why offer that if it&#x27;s really such an unworkable system?",Facebook
2016-09-27 07:00:07,Exponent: Making React Native Easier,"Yeah. That&#x27;s a good articulation of some of the problems but that&#x27;s tough to learn them the hard way. I wrote a comment below talking a bit about how a lot of these problems start to go away with Exponent but I wanted to offer some thoughts if you or your teammates have embarked on the raw React Native route.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve learned from working with React Native is that you want to stay fairly up to date with the frequent releases. The Exponent team puts a lot of work into upgrading our own dependencies and maintaining the Exponent API that other developers depend on.<p>Authors of components and other npm packages will update their code to work with the latest version of React Native. It takes energy to stay up to date since you need to read the release notes and breaking changes and sometimes it&#x27;s helpful to scan the commit history on the release branch. But this way you can use react-redux v4 and other actively developed dependencies.<p>On the other hand, though, sometimes component authors don&#x27;t maintain their projects or support one platform but not the other. When dependencies fall out of date there isn&#x27;t an easy answer. In the past I&#x27;ve fixed the issues myself and sent pull requests. Showing financial support is also another approach; my teammate Brent wrote a post about this: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.getexponent.com&#x2F;putting-your-money-where-your-package-json-is-e34a35099a1b"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.getexponent.com&#x2F;putting-your-money-where-your-p...</a>. The maintenance of open-source libraries isn&#x27;t unique to React Native but it&#x27;s perhaps exacerbated by its cross-platform nature and frequent release cycle.<p>For the issue about CPU ABIs, I believe React Native supports armeabi-v7a and x86 but not arm64-v8a or x64. It would be great to have native arm64 support but so far no one has needed it enough to implement it instead of using ndk.abiFilters. For what it&#x27;s worth, this works for Exponent and several other companies with apps that use React Native like Facebook.",Facebook
2016-09-26 18:02:46,Exponent: Making React Native Easier,"Hi there! I work on Exponent.<p>We intentionally chose to not let users drop down to native -- the idea of having an interpreted language that sits on top of a native runtime on multiple platforms is not a new one, and it allows for so many benefits that you lose out on if developers can add arbitrary compiled code with direct access to system APIs.<p>Additionally, there is a significant value-add of using Exponent in terms of upgrades. As great as React Native is, it also moves extremely fast and it can be difficult to keep up with new releases -- a change in React Native might cause several of your native dependencies to break, and you&#x27;ll need to fork those libraries and fix them if the maintainer isn&#x27;t keeping on the same schedule as you. Updates with Exponent are as simple as updating JavaScript, which has much less churn and breaking changes than the native side (the React API itself is very mature, the APIs for specific native components may change).<p>Another nice advantage of this is that you can work on an iOS app from Windows and Linux, because you don&#x27;t need to compile your app with Xcode (we handle builds for you when you want to ship to the app store, before that you can just use the Exponent client).<p>We ship with a bunch of APIs out of the box and are constantly improving them and adding more. We have analytics tools like Amplitude and Segment built in, Maps, Facebook login (working on Google Login), and more: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.getexponent.com&#x2F;versions&#x2F;latest&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.getexponent.com&#x2F;versions&#x2F;latest&#x2F;index.html</a><p>React Native is still very early, though, and Exponent is just a small team of seven, so we understand that we can&#x27;t possibly expose every API that developers working with the platform might want. So, we are working on a way for developers to be able to still take advantage of the Exponent toolchain and layer on native code. I&#x27;ve written up our approach in more detail here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.getexponent.com&#x2F;answered-on-slack-ejecting-from-exponent-154bdca57dc1#.yr55mmqtc"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.getexponent.com&#x2F;answered-on-slack-ejecting-from...</a>",Facebook

A Jazzercise class suddenly appeared in the coworking space I work out of, so I fled, and then I had to give a talk about Starfighter.<p>Responses: <i>(when I say &quot;your&quot; let&#x27;s just stipulate I mean Facebook)</i><p>* Your password validation overhead is .1% of <i>current</i> front end resources, but could be ratcheted up, and would be easier to ratchet up if they weren&#x27;t shared by other things.<p>* I totally understand why you keep the old MD5 cruft around --- but would add that it&#x27;s cruft that would be even less obvious if it lived behind an authentication server.<p>* I think it&#x27;s safer, simpler, cleaner, probably easier to scale, and definitely easier to change authentication if it lives in its own service rather than being implemented (in part) on a generic application server. As usage shifts from HTML front-end to all API, you might even be able to keep app servers from even <i>seeing</i> passwords.<p>* By &quot;assessed&quot;, I mean, worked on other people&#x27;s systems at this scale.<p>So I guess I&#x27;d wrap up with a question: if you had this to do over again, from scratch, the way you wanted to, would you have app servers do a password hash and then entangle it somehow with an HMAC operation from a crypto service, or would you have the whole password hash done on the crypto service directly?",Facebook

Facebook has similarly neutered their API to the point where it is nearly useless, and many businesses were crushed in the wake of the changes.  You seem to be saying that it&#x27;s only unhealthy when developers are affected, but that isn&#x27;t the case.  Developers have no &quot;inherent right to succeed on the good graces of another business allowing them to&quot; either,  yet you see that as unhealthy.<p>Publishers and developers are just users of the system, getting crushed when Facebook doesn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s getting a big enough cut.  I would also argue that Facebook actively blocking the sharing of external content that its users choose to share with each other simply because they aren&#x27;t getting their cut is different than the affected businesses believing they have an &quot;inherent right to succeed on the good graces of another business&quot;.  Businesses that don&#x27;t directly do anything on Facebook will be affected by this, because if their visitors wish to share their content, they will likely attempt to share it through Facebook.",Facebook

2016-07-21 04:53:36,The End of Microservices,"You say it as if it&#x27;s a bad thing... Compared to the alternative, fiefdoms really are a wonderful thing!<p>I once work for a giant fortune 500 corporation. Our department had a good 300 developers, and had been writing code for years. They had built the whose system using the classic, box-box-cylinder architecture. There were hundreds of little top tier &#x27;services&#x27;, but in practice, they all shared the same database, had to be deployed pretty much at the same time, and version upgrades had to go in lockstep. Every so often, database changes were necessary, and the world would grind to a halt for months to make the system still work after the migration: It was awful.<p>On top of this, having everyone using one stack really meant that a council of elders got to make tech decisions, and everyone else just did what they were told. This built a giant hierarchy. People near the top would never leave, because nowhere else would give them that much power. Talented developers would take years to gain influence, so they often just left. What remained was developers with no ambitions other than getting a paycheck... it was horrible.<p>The alternative was to let people maintain their own stacks, as long as they provided interfaces that other people could call. By limiting how much code could talk to a database, you didn&#x27;t need negotiations to change something: Teams made any change they wanted as long as they remained backwards compatible, and then had to lobby users to upgrade to newest API versions if they wanted to remove the backwards compatibility mess. It was awesome in comparison.<p>A gigantic place won&#x27;t have those problems, because they can invest money on making whatever tech decisions they made tenable: PHP is slow? Let&#x27;s build a new runtime and compiler, says Facebook! If you are tiny, you don&#x27;t need any of this BS, because if your team of 8 engineers can&#x27;t agree, your company will fail regardless. But when you have 200 engineers, it&#x27;s giving people more control over a piece of the pie or bleeding talent.<p>The one thing you still need to do is make sure teams have the right size, and people have enough accountability, that the product still works. You also need silly amounts of data marshaling and error checking compared to the monolith. But the terror of a company that can&#x27;t hire engineers because the only way to have any control over your daily life is to have been there for 5 years is just hard to compare. When people say they don&#x27;t want to work big corporate gigs, what they really mean is that monoliths become soul sucking.<p>So yes, I give thumbs up to fiefdoms, just like I&#x27;d rather have inefficiency in a republic vs a theoretically efficient dictatorship.",Facebook
2016-07-18 18:18:48,Serverless Architectures,"The phrase that Amazon used when launching lambda was &#x27;deploy code not servers&#x27;. To me this sums up what &#x27;serverless&#x27; means. It means the developer doesn&#x27;t have to worry about servers in any way.<p>With AWS Lambda&#x2F;API Gateway (and arguably with Google App Engine before it) you take away the toil of having to:<p><pre><code>  * Manage&#x2F;deploy servers
  * Monitor&#x2F;maintain&#x2F;upgrade servers
  * Figuring out tools to deploy your app to your server
  * Scaling an app globally.
  * Coping with outages in a data-centre&#x2F;availability
  * Worry about load-balancing &amp; scaling infrastructure

It&#x27;s not the cliche of CRUD LOB vs. &quot;Cool things&quot;, but of making apps targeted at the end user vs. creating a shared infrastructure (whether it is a library or a cloud service), and there are many levels down that rabbit hole.<p>But that being said, Unless you are working for a very conventional small or midsize business with no plans of rapid growth (and businesses of these rarely employ large teams that need leadership anyway), it&#x27;s never going to be &quot;just CRUD&quot; or just slapping a client GUI in front o a database backend&quot;. With large datasets or many users you have to plan your storage and query patterns for scalability, when precision is crucial you have to design for consistency when a real-time response is required you need to reduce latency and when business requirements change often you need to design for flexibility, when your company has multiple clients you need to design a good API, and so on. In most cases you must balance between several requirements, and I haven&#x27;t even gotten to security yet, which is a too often neglected requirement for almost every system out there. I also didn&#x27;t touch all the peripheral requirements for having automated tests (and designing for testability), designing a CI pipeline and educating junior devs about revision control workflows and DevOps practices.<p>Handling all of that doesn&#x27;t require the same technical skills required for writing kernel code, a ray tracing engine or a database engine (all of them different skills in their own respect), but to be able to design a good system and give guidance to junior developers you definitely need more than 2-3 years of experience.<p>Yes, many companies choose to ignore what I&#x27;ve just said, and hire low-level programmers anyway, and often put an MBA (who did some formulas in Excel back then) to (micro-)manage them. Of course the products they turn out are buggy, hard to upgrade, fall down to pieces under the smallest hint of load, end up requiring expensive hardware, have gaping security holes and all-in-all cost their failings end up costing the business dearly.<p>This blasé approach to group 1 development is very common in the so-called &quot;enterprise world&quot;, but that&#x27;s just because the organizational elite over there (as opposed to most of Silicon Valley) is not even tangentially technical. That&#x27;s understandable: take a CS-driven company like Google or an engineer-driven company like Facebook, and you&#x27;ll get the mirror image.

-----------------------------------------------<p>As promised, below is a quick high-level summary of the malware outlined in the subject. We&#x27;ve been dealing with the malware for months and while some would call is spam, we consider it malware simply because any of the executables or Chrome extensions could be changed to steal passwords, credit cards or every document off a system. We welcome any help in dealing with these actors and would also be interested in new ways to combat malicious extensions, both Chrome and Firefox as those are only increasing in usage.<p>If you would like more information on the technical details of the binaries, extensions or other loaders, feel free to shoot me a message. If there&#x27;s enough interest, I will just spam the list, but would prefer to keep this to the higher level points, so others gain a better understanding of the threat.<p>-= Summary =-<p>BePush is a set of Turkish-based actors who use innovative techniques to spread malicious code and spam through social networking sites and ad-based networks. Those involved in the development of BePush malware are constantly adjusting their TTPs to account for changes in detection or disruption. Actors favor multiple levels of obfuscation through the use of short-url redirectors, third-party hosting providers and multi-stage payloads. Despite high infection rates, local law enforcement has yet to take an interest in pursuing those actors involved.<p>-= Infection Process =-<p>Based on our logs, primary infection processes tend to occur through direct traffic, followed by Facebook and various ad providers. Shortened URL links are shared among users which typically traverse through a series of redirects to a landing page mimicking Facebook infrastructure and using porn as a lure to install a plug-in. Depending on the attacker behavior, payloads may be delivered in the form of a Google Chrome extension (hosted within the store) or through an executable (likely AutoHotkey, but could be Pyinstaller based) that later replaces Chrome with a version of Chromium with their malicious extension.<p>Once installed, malicious code will make use of the Facebook Graph API in order to make requests&#x2F;posts on behalf of the infected user using a stolen access token. In order to establish a high infection count, the malicious code will often create pages with malicious links, post statuses&#x2F;comments to the user&#x27;s friends and spam within certain application pages. Once the spreading routine completes, the process generally begins again with the infected user&#x27;s friends.<p>-= Motives and Capabilities =-<p>It appears the primary motivation for the BePush actors is the money gained through the sale of Facebook likes, followers or various ad-network and affiliate partners. In some cases, Facebook observed BePush actors including a bundled bitcoin miner, but it never appeared to gain much popularity.<p>From a capabilities perspective, actors involved with BePush appear to pay attention to how their code is detected. When numbers begin to dwindle, changes to the code or 3rd-party providers are made. Actors demonstrate a level of understanding in .Net programming, Python, JavaScript and techniques used to detect spam. We have also observed the actors repurposing browser exploits, but we never saw these used against users.<p>-= Third-Party Provider Usage =-<p>BePush favors the use of free and open infrastructure in order to keep their campaigns alive long enough to get a strong infection foothold. The following providers have been observed in some capacity:<p><pre><code>  - Amazon AWS - Used for hosting content
  - Dropbox - Used to host binaries
  - Box.com (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;box.com&#x2F;) - Used to host binaries
  - Bitly - Used for redirection
  - Tinyurl - Used for redirection
  - Godaddy - Used for redirection
  - WhosAmungUs - Used for campaign tracking
  - Stellar - Used for bitcoin wallet hosting
  - Imgur - Used for redirection 
  - Dot.tk - Used for redirection
  - Google - Used for redirection, Chrome extensions and binary hosting
  - CloudFlare - Used to obfuscate real infrastructure
  - Microsoft Azure - Used to host binaries
</code></pre>
-= Detection and Research =-<p>BePush has a limited set of providers they prefer to use and through industry relationships, we have been able to put pressure on the attackers. Here are a couple items we noticed when doing disruption work that helped in making a larger impact against the group.<p>Using passive DNS data to identify other domains sitting on the same IP address (these guys don&#x27;t use a lot of unique servers)
Use ESET (<i>Facebook</i>) or Microsoft (<i>Kilim</i>) AV signatures to identify new binaries being used

2016-06-18 17:43:14,JSON Web Tokens vs. Sessions,"With JWT, you have the option of stateful or stateless. Stateless gives you cheap federation (any server can authenticate a token issued by another server), but you lose the ability to handle revocation without some sort of statefulness introduced (a redis cache with revoked token ids for example). Stateful is basically a non-cookie based session.<p>One possible alternative to enable auto-renewal is to issue a new token with every request, and manually bake in the persistence of the token into your front end client.<p>In my own system, I have login with facebook, which submits current FB auth tokens with every request, after which I issue my own app token with all the necessary authorization information for my business logic. Whenever the app token expires, I attempt re-authentication using facebook login, and if successful I send back an updated app token. The front end client has logic built in to compare and swap app tokens if they change and persist in sessionStorage.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hacky. I&#x27;m a little worried about vulnerabilities that I might be introducing. I luck out in that I don&#x27;t have a public API which would force the client to implement my front end logic. But it works, for now.",Facebook

There is some value to be gained from a development ecosystem, undeniably.<p>The difference between what I&#x27;m saying is that the sheer magnitude of <i>unmonetized</i> Twitter Web users makes whatever small fish monetization increasing Twitter use with their integration look like chump change.<p>Now, there are several big players such as Periscope, Vine, Meerkat, that could have benefitted Twitter greatly from offering a development ecosystem.   But there are two reasons why they wouldn&#x27;t:<p>1) Twitter, like Facebook, is big enough - or, more accurately, <i>are expected to be big enough</i> - to be in the &quot;acquirer&quot; phase where they derive more value <i>competing against</i> and acquiring than <i>playing with</i> these popular new services.   
However, we&#x27;ve seen much of the industry being overvalued and some of us believe a small company can do more, faster, on a technical level than a big company due to bureaucracy, so expectations aren&#x27;t always matching up to reality.<p>Vine and Periscope were eventually acquired by Twitter.  And Meerkat was forced to pivot.<p>2) There are cost-benefit analyses that neither you, nor I, are privy to which found developing and maintaining an API by relatively highly-paid employees not worth the benefits seen by its integration by other companies.<p>&gt; Many startups or businesses in general look elsewhere for the information that is available on Twitter.<p>Are you sure of this?   Businesses and other startups alike <i>still</i> use Twitter for <i>engagement</i>, and there is great information to be pulled from Twitter, assuming they have the ability to act on the metrics available.",Facebook

You are meant to do that yourself with SSH or a web server, where you should be able to have more restrict access to some special folders.<p>About using a single repo, it does make sense to have all code that interact with each other at the same place.

2016-05-28 11:10:45,Scaling Mercurial at Facebook,"I generally see two reactions to the &quot;one codebase to rule them all&quot; approach (used by Facebook, Google, et. al):<p>1. Holy god why would you let your code grow to such a massive, interdependent scale? Just release everything separately and versioned so that breaking changes don&#x27;t affect everyone all at once. The idea of git being a bottleneck is absurd and you are using it wrong.<p>2. This is a very reasonable, practical approach to sharing code across a company. It reduces siloing and ensures that major refactors can happen in one pass without a ton of coordination. Better to fix the version control system than waste endless resources refactoring millions of lines of code.<p>Both reaction is valid. Having worked in both styles of codebase, I recognize that there are trade-offs in either case. The optimal solution depends on the project and the team.<p>Sometimes the path of least resistance--that is to say, the path to getting things shipped and, in turn, making money--is to let the codebase grow organically and worry about cleaning up any messy interdependencies later, once you have a better idea of what code you even need to keep around. In this scenario, it&#x27;s important to recognize that developer efficiency is going to be an uphill battle in the long run, but if you are proactive about maintenance and tooling improvements then this approach can still be relatively painless.<p>Other times, especially when you&#x27;re working on a tried-and-tested product with a clear API and a dedicated team, it can be productive to split it out and let the team manage their own versioning and releases. This becomes especially useful if the product is open source. (For instance, I wonder how Facebook manages its open source releases relative to its shared Mercurial codebase.) In this scenario, developer efficiency is usually less of a problem, as proper use of versioning can ensure faster, more agile updates to each product. But the downside is that your company as a whole can end up in a kind of versioning hell, where every project depends on a different version of every other project, and keeping everything up to date can require a huge amount of coordination.<p>So, in the end, pick your poison. My reaction, years ago, was more along the lines of #1, but I used to be much more of an idealist earlier in my career.",Facebook

2016-04-19 17:11:54,Facebook Chef cookbooks,"Using custom resources, like LWRPs, doesn&#x27;t provide the same flexibility. Most of the time you fall into making something which works akin to the `cron` internal resource which doesn&#x27;t provide managing an entire system but instead a single entry which means you get neither automatic cleanup nor automatic fall back [to an earlier value]. It also means there&#x27;s no good way to stack configs. You can (obviously) build a resource which manages the entire file&#x2F;subsystem (poise does this, for example), but even then, you don&#x27;t get the ability for everyone to override things later in the run... and we want the final service owner to be able to change anything anyone before them has set. It&#x27;s a key part of being able to scale people... and for us to have such a small core chef team (4-5 people).<p>In addition, using simple hashes and arrays makes it much simpler for your average software engineer to make changes they want - they have to learn little to no Chef in the simple case... even not knowing ruby they can figure out variable assignments.<p>The monolithic repo works well for us given we use grocery-delivery (github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;grocery-delivery). We have no environments (see my ChefConf keynote in 2013 for a full breakdown of how we do run things) and no cookbook versioning... we run directly off of head. We use a combination of taste-tester (github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;taste-tester) for general testing and and sharding (see `node.in_shard?` and `node.in_flexible_shard?` in the `fb_helpers` cookbook) to control the speed of rollout of risky changes.<p>To be clear we use no precedences at all except `default` - using other precedences will in fact likely break our model since it causes the node-read code to merge things rather than treating it like a single hash. The model here is last-writer-wins always.<p>As for tests, people consuming these cookbooks are simply assigning variables, so there&#x27;s not a lot to test in a wrapper cookbook. &quot;Did the attribute get the value I assigned it&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like a useful unittest... that should be covered by Chef&#x27;s unittests itself. For our more complicated cookbooks we&#x27;ve unit-tested the API and where we could we released those (see fb_fstab), and we have some other unittests we haven&#x27;t yet been able to release that hopefully we&#x27;ll come back around to.<p>Hope that helps,

2016-04-17 22:05:44,Pagination with rel=“next” and rel=“prev” (2011),"As fbonetti already said, LIMIT is the canonical way to do it with SQL databases (I would just add to their comment that you should ensure a positive page_size and offset, because &quot;LIMIT -5&quot; is invalid in at least MySQL, and to limit the page size to some sensible values).<p>For NoSQL, specifically (only?) CouchDB, you start iterating from a given key (in SQL, this would effectively be &quot;WHERE id &gt;= $start ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT n&quot;).<p>This difference is why I would recommend, especially for paginated REST APIs, to provide links to the next&#x2F;prev pages, so API clients can follow these links without thinking about how pagination is accomplished exactly. To prevent people from guessing the inner workings and working around your links, you can encode the parameters in a &quot;cursor&quot; (so instead of ?pagesize=20&amp;page=10 you could have ?cursor=base64encode(&quot;20,10&quot;) (SQL) or ?cursor=base64encode(&quot;$startKey&quot;) (NoSQL)). IIRC Facebook does it this way. Encrypting or authenticating the cursor is IMHO overblown here, given cursor values can be easily validated and rejected if fiddled with.<p>Using an opaque cursor also gives you the ability to change how pagination works without breaking existing API clients.<p>If you plan for lots of data and many pages, think twice before outputting links to all pages (on a website) or outputting the total number of elements (in an API). COUNT(*) on InnoDB is slow and I heard it&#x27;s not the quickest thing in NoSQL databases either.",Facebook

2016-03-30 11:10:18,React Native for OS X,"React Native (RN) is not for all apps, it has its uses if what your app does is mainly text delivery, example news app. One of the more complicated app that uses React Native is Discord for iOS (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;35309471&#x2F;is-discord-mobile-app-really-built-with-react-native"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;35309471&#x2F;is-discord-mobil...</a>), a Slack like chat app. That was then but I&#x27;m not sure the latest version is still RN heavy. You can actually build a native iOS app, and then add RN as part of your app. The tweet by Discord that said they are using RN is deleted.<p>Some reservations to choose RN: RN is possible due to the JavaScriptCore framework build by Apple. It is the bridge between JavaScript code and Cocoa API. Apple designed this so that you can use JavaScript as scripting language for Cocoa. The popular Sketch for OS X is using the precise JavaScriptCore to power its plug-in scripting feature. I guess Apple never have thought JavaScriptCore could be used the way RN does. Choosing RN means your app is relying on Apple&#x27;s decision on JavaScriptCore API. Someone please enlighten me if RN is still possible or not if Apple remove JavaScriptCore.<p>JavaScriptCore opens up the Cocoa API, but does not give you a JavaScript ready API. So RN has to implement the bridge internally. So when iOS 10 is released, you will have some lag waiting for new features or changes to be supported by RN. I guess this is common problem to all cross-platform framework.<p>In order to implement RN for Android, Facebook implements its own JavaScripCore for Android. I have no Android experience, but what I read is RN app for Android is not performing as natively as its iOS counterpart.<p>If your business rely on all Apple&#x27;s platform, then choosing RN does not help as there is no RN for watchOS and tvOS.<p>React Native will make app manager and web-dev team happy, but not those who treasure the last mile UX experiences. But is could also be useful for those startups creating their first MVP. Get app release fast and then change to native codes when you got the traction. Is this good or bad startup advice?<p>It will be a different ballgame if Facebook announce they are moving to use 100% React Native for Facebook for iOS app.",Facebook
2016-03-17 00:57:32,GraphQL Deep Dive: The Cost of Flexibility,"So basically you starts with React in the client. Of course React is new and shiny yet mandates that you do things differently when dealing with mutable data, so you need to adopt Redux. It creates a &quot;impendance mismatch&quot; with how REST API work, so you need to use GraphQL instead of REST endpoints, now you get that N+1 problem with RDBMS and GraphQL , so you need to add DataLoader on top ? what next ? having to ditch RDBMS and use facebook&#x27;s solution whatever it is ? All I see is React generating an avalanche of issues and impedance mismatches that lead to having to change server-side code and potentially the datastore, just to fit a front-end js view library ?<p>&gt; For a simple RESTful API endpoint logic, it’s easy to analyze, detect, and solve N+1 issues by enhancing the constructed SQL queries.

It&#x27;s a bit harsh to say they&#x27;re not doing enough faster by judging them against non banking startups.<p>I guess it seems like alot of these services are unbundling banks but it&#x27;s just a handful like Transferwise. The &#x27;core&#x27; banking features are hard to unbundle. I guess P2P lending is sort of a unbundle in a way but its at a different vertical.<p>To put it another way I guess: What are UK banks missing that is available elsewhere that would improve banking services (besides customer support), or even more generally?",Facebook
2016-03-03 16:58:09,Visual Studio Code for Go,"Hi. I know C# in amateur fashion and Go professionally. I think a lot of people here will give you a very positive review of Go. Since they&#x27;ve got that covered, let me tell you what you&#x27;re giving up from C# or F# and why I won&#x27;t use Go. Maybe you can form a balanced conclusion from the aggregates, because I find Go to be very polarizing.<p><i>Concurrency</i><p>Async: Go uses channels for all concurrency. Period. This mechanism, is sort of like half of the Erlang Actor philosophy, but even more lightweight. Channels and goroutines are constantly coming into and out of existence and you feel no real shame doing it. Even simple tasks often need them becuase Go&#x27;s I&#x2F;O libraries tend to be async-first.<p>Compared to C# and F#&#x27;s async, I think you will find this to be very different, but not particularly better in terms of performance. F# offers a very similar abstration with very similar performance characteristics and C# async methods are using a very similar mechanism under the covers to provide closure over computation chains in what amounts to a kind of effectful state monad. Don&#x27;t sell your home team short on this front; MS&#x27;s work there is cutting edge.<p><i>Error Handling</i><p>In daily programming, Go&#x27;s weakest story is error handling. While many people rightly cricisize try-catch error handling as a primitive and error prone mechanism, the Go solution is to say, &quot;We all hate C but actually C erorr handling was fine so long as you have multiple return values at the syntactic level.&quot; So you often return a success value (which is nullable) and an error value (which is nullable) and then ask the caller to check on the null.<p>This is basically error code checking. People will say it isn&#x27;t, but really it is. It really is. And unlike some other langauges Go provides no facilities for &quot;chaining&quot; these operations. So you end up writing if err != nil { ... } over and over.<p>In the case of chained I&#x2F;O operations, this is really tiresome. It also often leads to code repeating or some somewhat convoluted dispatch logic.<p>Go Error values also suffer from Go&#x27;s other issue, it doesn&#x27;t have an extensible type system. Instead it has &quot;interfaces&quot;. In practice, what this means is that it&#x27;s very difficult to expose new error types or give your clients good ways to dispatch on them. While this means error handling code is lightweight, it also often means it has to do silly things like regex and error message string to find out what a specific failure was.<p>Some people value that approach. If you&#x27;re writing an executable it&#x27;s actually good, becuase it&#x27;s probably better to fail fast in a recognizable way. But if you&#x27;re writing a library and offering OTHER people that facility you can&#x27;t support them well (and you will not be well supported by Go libraries).<p><i>Build Tooling</i><p>Go&#x27;s general toolchain is solid and its compiler is wicked fast. But its build story is still really, really bad. Go originally had this mountain of filesystem around every project that was tricky and error prone to share around projects.<p>With recent releases, they&#x27;ve moved to something that resembles Ruby On Rails&#x27;s &quot;vendor&quot; approach, where a sub directory contains a whole checkout of each dependency&#x27;s code. This is actually a pretty major improvement (in part becuase it works better with Github, which is Go&#x27;s primary distribution mechanism). But even with this change, managing a codebase over time is error prone. Unlike Maven and Nuget, there is no enforced concept of version releases (nor discipline around snapshotting) in Github. So if the maintainer of the library has poor discipline (or if there is code poorly tagged during a maintainer change), it can be difficult to get the exact version of a library you want with the exact bugfixes you need.<p>Google&#x27;s response to this is, &quot;We don&#x27;t have this problem because everyone at Google always keeps &#x2F;master clean and we basically never make breaking API changes.&quot; But if you talk to them internally, the reality is more what you&#x27;d expect. Sometimes a lot of time is lost fixing that.<p><i>Everything else I wanted to say (aka &quot;Conclusions&quot;)</i><p>On balance, Go is a good environment for making executables. But a lot of why people like it stems from negative experiences they&#x27;ve had with scripting languages and their poor packaging story, Java and its problems keeping up with other managed language runtimes (and oh god its package process is just silly and antiquated).<p>You&#x27;ve already got cutting edge concurrency, static builds, a lightweight crossplatform runtime with CoreCLR, and pretty fast cross-compilation. For you, what you might find refreshing is how very clean and unified the Go langauge is. It is many things, but one thing it excels at appealing to is the pythonic there-is-one-way-get-in-line crowd. It is small, purpose-built, and singularly uncomplicated. C# has a &quot;history&quot; and &quot;legacy feature support.&quot; Things like delegates that have fallen out of fashion now but are still lurking in the codebase or backing other more modern features.<p>If you want to try the concurrency model but don&#x27;t know if you wanna commit to a whole new runtime, do try F# if you haven&#x27;t yet. You can get great performance and the channel based concurrency out of it, and I think most people would agree its error handling is light years ahead of what Go offers.<p>If you&#x27;d like to try a totally new language with really cool concurrency semantics on a purpose-built runtime, can I recommend Nim-lang.org? Nim is <i>amazing</i>. It&#x27;s got one of the most ambitiously cool ideas I&#x27;ve seen for micro-optimized concurrency code since reading Marlow&#x27;s paper on Haxl for facebook.",Facebook
2016-03-02 00:16:49,The Sign Up with Google Mistake You Can't Fix,"&gt; What is truly scary is that the banks and financial institutions have not implemented OAuth. Currently, financial data is provided to third party apps via aggregators, like Plaid and Yodlee.<p>Hi. I was the CTO of Level Money, that ultimately had a meta-aggregation platform on top of all the major aggregators. We were acquired by Capital One. Disclosures: complete.<p>Can I just put out there: every major FI has talked about OAuth2. We all know about OAuth2. It&#x27;s entirely within our technical capabilities to make an API and then allow OAuth2 access. We could even make said access public. The &quot;can they&quot; is answered: yes we could. Yes, we have prototypes.<p>And yes, there are non-technical obstacles. Pardon me while I Nod Dance &amp; Amble.<p>But there is a larger question about the aggregation problem. Banks are rightly concerned that if they do open these up, they&#x27;ll be consumed wholesale by the major tech companies. You could imagine a world where Google partners with your bank to make a pretty amazing experience, but in the process it&#x27;s almost certain that Google would have a significant upper hand. Most banks (even C1360, which I and many other people are working constantly on modernizing) simply aren&#x27;t ready to work with giants like Microsoft, Google or Facebook as equals. That, sadly, will take years as these organizations realize they have to do this.<p>We&#x27;re all in sort of a slow motion race towards this goal. Slow motion compared to the outside world (as I am all to keenly aware), that is. Internally, the process by which we do this is hugely complicated by US law and regulation. There is this wonderful thing where &quot;regulatory capture&quot; backfires and then you&#x27;re imprisoned. For every thing that a bank charter enables, it closes off another 2-3 things that never mattered until things started being judged by their slickness in a mobile app context.<p>As for disconnecting from aggregators, let me tell you as an insider what you can do. Change your password. No really, change your bank password. EVERY major aggregator has a flow that requires they respect this at a technical level. If that fails, it&#x27;s on your bank and you should shout at them VERY loudly.<p>But before you do, make sure you are ready to prove yourself as a banker. What will happen with most aggregators is that they&#x27;ll have to decide, &quot;is this person actually gone or is this stupid web scraper just having a bit of a problem?&quot; They&#x27;ll try and log in again, at least once in most cases.

In fact, part of the recent changes (splitting React into React and ReactDOM) have been in order to keep the core React library as small as possible.<p>React itself doesn&#x27;t do very much at all, but when you&#x27;re using React, you&#x27;re using almost everything React has to offer, and then can choose what you want to add on top of that.<p>Take a look at the top level API [1] and compnenent API [2].

2016-02-20 00:10:27,New Versioning Scheme for React,"&gt;That&#x27;s a maintenance nightmare!<p>Are you using React? I’m curious if this is your feedback on the pace of changes, or if this is just a guess.<p>In reality React API surface area is pretty small so most changes are automated by codemods. Codemods are programs that modify your source code. They work pretty well because Facebook uses them on a large scale.<p>Not everything is covered by codemods but generally the feeling I get from talking to the community is that React moves at an acceptable rate, and changes take about a day to apply once a three months for most apps. Deprecation warnings also give you several months to fix use cases that will be unsupported in the next version.<p>In return, this allows React to become a better library and not stagnate. I see your point <i>in theory</i> but please talk to the people using React, and you might find that it is not a problem in practice.",Facebook
2016-02-20 00:05:43,New Versioning Scheme for React,"Are you using React and voicing your concern? Or are you making a guess?<p>Every three months might be too often for a tool like curl. In case of React, the community seems to be happy with the tradeoff between moving forward and keeping the old code working.<p>You might want to ask a few people who use React to draw the conclusions. I talk to a lot of people in the React ecosystem, and so far the feedback I heard is that updating React has been the least of their worries, compared to some other libraries in the ecosystem which are far less stable.<p>Personally, I updated a fairly large (~1000 modules) app from React 0.11, to 0.12, to 0.13. After the ecosystem catches up and libraries release compatible updates (if they need to), it always took less than a day to upgrade. Doesn’t seem like a big price to pay for avoiding stagnation and actually improving the library.<p>And I wasn’t even using codemods which React team ships (and widely uses internally at Facebook). Codemods just convert your code through most of the API changes automatically.",Facebook
2016-02-19 21:45:04,New Versioning Scheme for React,"You might want to take a look at the blog documenting the releases[1]. Breaking changes happen, but not more often than once in three months. Every breaking change is preceded by a deprecation warning in the previous release, and many changes are automated through codemods. And of course the API surface area is small which is why it’s possible to move fast without breaking things.<p>Don’t forget Facebook has a large React codebase so it cares very much about automating migrations.<p>If React switched to 1.0, with some breaking changes every three months, it would be 14.0 again in a couple of years. Then googling for tutorials would get confusing. Why not do that now?<p>[1]: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;blog</a>",Facebook

We are human... the talking ape. There isn&#x27;t anything more basic than communication. Why should we send it through one company?

2016-02-10 22:16:22,Twitter’s User Growth Goes Nowhere as It Meets Revenue Expectations of $710M,"I know there are theoretical alternatives to Twitter, but until the appropriate userbase is out there then they&#x27;re not truly viable alternatives. I know that&#x27;s a Catch-22, or a paradox, or whatever you want to call it, but that&#x27;s the sad reality for those of us that would like to leave the platform. So, in lieu of leaving, here are the features I feel like would help Twitter retain me as a user:<p>1. Bring back custom apps! Twitter is a <i>service</i>, and I want control over how I access that service. This would also take such a huge burden off of Twitter: don&#x27;t care about the super bowl? Use an app that lets you filter hashtags, piece of cake! So many features can be implemented on top of a service, with no extra effort from Twitter. I get that this could  conceivably enable filtering timeline ads, but seriously they can just pull API keys for apps that do that, it&#x27;s a non-issue.<p>2. Let me subscribe to ideas, not just people. If I <i>do</i> care about the super bowl, maybe let me turn on push notifications for tweets about it from people within my network for whom I otherwise do not have push notifications enabled.<p>3. Make chronological timelines a setting. Not an option, not a tab, a semi-permanently enabled <i>setting</i>. It&#x27;s the most annoying thing about Facebook right now, having to explicitly re-enable chronological timelines every week or so when Facebook has &quot;forgotten&quot;. As it stands, even that much is an improvement over Twitter&#x27;s proposed always-on non-chronological timeline.<p>4. Don&#x27;t nanny me unless I ask you to. There have been reports that Twitter has blocked notifications for @replied tweets because Twitter suspected the tweet would be offensive. I get that harassment is an issue and that Twitter was trying to be proactive, but make it an option. The user in this case was failing to be notified of tweets they <i>wanted</i> to see, and had no way to disable the &quot;feature&quot;.<p>5. Inconsistency foments distrust. If you want that blue check mark to mean something then you&#x27;d best lay out a solid and strict process for them. I&#x27;ve seen at least one person have theirs removed over unsubstantiated claims, yet more egregious offenders have kept theirs throughout. I&#x27;ve seen others go through the process for acquire their blue checks and they always seem to have different requirements. Some reported having to change their profile name to their real name, others said they had to put their actual photo on their profile.",Facebook

It&#x27;s a pain in the butt sometimes, especially when making schema changes, but ensuring everything works properly even when you have multiple versions running in production can really help with confidence in making changes.<p>You do have to think several steps ahead when making big changes; the (internal-only) project I work on is in the process of completely changing our DB schema and we&#x27;re redoing our API completely as well.  We&#x27;re attempting to keep our old API running in parallel while migrating literally everything underneath it, which is a fun challenge. It results in a lot of what can feel like busywork, but when the alternative is bringing down your service temporarily, it&#x27;s worth it. An hour of planned downtime to do an offline migration can easily turn into several days when Murphy strikes. That&#x27;s OK when you&#x27;re first building a system, but once anyone is relying on you to get their work done, it is just pure pain.",Facebook

2016-02-03 21:32:42,On Your Cute Release Notes,"Writing release notes for consumer software doesn&#x27;t make sense. They are a throwback to boxed software and should be abolished:<p>1. With A&#x2F;B testing and server-side feature flags they don&#x27;t reflect what the user will see.<p>2. With technology like React Native and PhoneGap changes are decoupled from shipping an updated ipa&#x2F;apk.<p>3. With most apps shipping quickly (some every 2 weeks) localization of release notes becomes a long pole.<p>4. Simple text is not effective for showing users potential benefits or training how to use something.<p>5. They can be misleading...saying something like &quot;fixed a startup crash&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean for a particular user the startup crash they are experiencing is fixed.<p>6. More and more users have automatic update turned on and don&#x27;t even see release notes is the app store UI.<p>7. Users don&#x27;t read release notes (or anything really). HN folks may read them...normal people do not.<p>Do you know what version of Facebook.com you are using and all the new features they push out daily? How about Gmail? Nope, you use products for core functionality and then discover what&#x27;s new in the course of actually using them and not in a text pop-up up front. This is how apps should be.<p>A much better and more effective strategy is contextual in-app callouts &#x2F; new user experiences.<p>The above <i>only</i> applies to consumer products. I believe release notes can be valuable for enterprises&#x2F;frameworks&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;tools&#x2F;etc.<p>PS: I know all about the tradeoffs...I wrote release notes for Mac OS X, Firefox, and Facebook.

2016-01-27 10:32:51,My Reaction to React,"For most problems, the following is how you define a component:<p><pre><code>    function Comp(state) {
        return React.createElement(
          &#x27;div&#x27;, &#x2F;&#x2F; tag name
          {}, &#x2F;&#x2F; props&#x2F;attributes
          &#x27;Hello &#x27;, state.name &#x2F;&#x2F; children
        );
    }
</code></pre>
And this is how you use it:<p><pre><code>    ReactDOM.render(
      React.createElement(Comp, {name: &#x27;World&#x27;}),
      document.getElementById(&#x27;stage&#x27;)
    );
</code></pre>
So in those situations the entire surface of the React API consists of two functions: React.createElement and ReactDOM.render. And if you use JSX, you won&#x27;t even directly use React.createElement in your code.<p>React is conceptually trivial. The API has been getting tighter with each release. React is in active development but so are all of its competitors[1][2]. React is production ready -- Facebook is even dogfooding the pre-releases in production.<p>[1]: in fact, when a library&#x2F;frameworks stops being actively developed people start assuming it&#x27;s dead. Counter-example: Redux is no longer actively being developed because it is officially complete and the implementation is so straightforward and resilient it can&#x27;t really be improved right now.<p>[2]: the reason it&#x27;s bogus to compare it to Angular2 &quot;because that&#x27;s not finished yet either&quot; is that Angular2 is being built to spec whereas React is being developed under use. Angular2 will be &quot;finished&quot; when the full spec is implemented. React will be &quot;finished&quot; when real-world use shows no further need to change -- by that definition none of the alternatives (including Angular2 post-&quot;final&quot;) is &quot;finished&quot; either.",Facebook

Several of the Flux libraries I just mentioned actually deprecated themselves and put up notices to use Redux instead. As of the time of this writing Redux has almost 13,000 stars on GitHub.<p>Relay&#x2F;Falcor are really part of an entirely different thing than React; they are about replacing the traditional REST API with an entirely new paradigm.",Facebook
2016-01-25 22:20:58,What Is Zero UI? (2015),"I&#x27;m a huge proponent of the Zero UI movement. I gave a talk last year at a local Google DevFest about a CMS I created for a Priest friend&#x27;s Church that didn&#x27;t have any user interface to speak of. It relied on Google Drive to host all the files that the staff and teachers at his Parish needed to edit, and all they needed to do was leverage their existing knowledge of the OS&#x27;s file system and Microsoft Word to do it. A script runs every half-hour to update the static site based on the changes to and additions of files in their shared Google Drive account.<p>All of the pictures come directly from their Facebook account via the Facebook API and the weekly PDF newsletter is sent using Mailchimp and pulled from their Google Drive as well. They went from almost no engagement from the staff to close to 100% engagement after we implemented the system.<p>Before that the site was built on Drupal and needlessly complex. Nobody used it. It&#x27;s so easy to forget how daunting learning another user interface can be for the average person. We may think we&#x27;re being clever when we create our beautiful snowflake UI&#x27;s but all we&#x27;re doing is adding more work to somebody&#x27;s already full plate (and K-12 teachers&#x27; plates are overflowing). There&#x27;s a lot of cognitive overhead that comes with things like remembering username&#x2F;password combinations, how to upload files to a website (or understanding what that even <i>means</i>), navigating around a website, editing text in something other than Microsoft Word, and other skills and knowledge we take for granted.<p>With the Google-Drive-As-A-CMS implementation, none of the teachers had to learn anything new. They simply needed to leverage skills they were already expected to have (filesystems, Word, Excel, Powerpoint).<p>I&#x27;d love for more of us software developers and designers to take a step back and ask ourselves the question &quot;am I making my user&#x27;s life easier, or am I adding complexity to it?&quot;.

2015-12-24 17:18:21,Open Letter to Mozilla: Bring Back Persona,"LinkedIn and Facebook can do this because your email is not your username.  There likely isn&#x27;t really a username in those systems, just a user id.  Almost all systems have a user id, but the distinction here is slightly different.  Instead of a user record which has an id, username and possibly full name, Facebook likely has a user record with an id, a (display) username, and then there is a separate set of auth records with the multiple ways you can authenticate to the account, such as emails and passwords, API tokens, phone numbers, etc.<p>It may not sound like a big distinction, but there <i>is</i> a big distinction there.  Instead of your username being your email address, they&#x27;ve abstracted the authentication from the core user record such that usernames are not used for authentication, so don&#x27;t have to mutate if the authentication identifier (email address, phone number) changes, just some auth settings.  This is obviously a much more extensible and robust way to deal with authentication over time, but it&#x27;s also obvious it&#x27;s much more complex than a simple username&#x2F;password pair.",Facebook

2015-11-25 01:02:38,What is a coder's worst nightmare? (2014),"I used to describe myself as a web standards evangelist ten years ago and my first instinct when I saw React (both because of JSX and because it was from Facebook) was to laugh and shake my head (until I decided to &quot;give it five minutes&quot; and found out I was wrong) so I hope my perspective could make some sense to you.<p>--<p>Just to clarify: React is not about killing the separation of concerns. React is about one thing: converting application state to a component tree and rendering that component tree to the DOM via highly optimised diffing.<p>At the base level, React turns state into component trees. Similarly, Redux is only about managing state and changes to that state. These are fairly straightforward ideas but having them as clearly defined building blocks with an extremely straightforward API (Redux moreso than React but in the trivial case a React component as of 0.14 can be a plain old pure function) radically simplifies application development.<p>I&#x27;ll say it again: application development. I haven&#x27;t said anything about HTML and CSS yet. This is as relevant to the web as it is to native application development and it&#x27;s not an accident that React has been decoupled from ReactDOM with the latter now being merely the implementation detail of going the last mile and rendering things to the DOM (or to HTML strings) and maintaining DOM bindings and diffs.<p>--<p>A quick interlude: JSX is not HTML. It looks like XML and in many examples it has HTML tag names in it, but it&#x27;s not HTML -- nor is it XML for that matter. It&#x27;s just (entirely optional but very useful once you get over the initial visceral discomfort) syntactic sugar for defining component trees (not DOM subtrees). The syntax is obviously based on XML but it is a lot simpler and the familiarity obviously helps.<p>--<p>One thing most people don&#x27;t understand about React (not least because React isn&#x27;t vocal enough about it -- just like Flux wasn&#x27;t vocal enough about certain concepts until Redux came along and showcased why they&#x27;re important and useful) is that you can and should distinguish between presentational components and application logic.<p>If you use Redux (or Flux -- but with Flux there&#x27;s the problem that most things called Flux aren&#x27;t actually Flux because nobody really understood it) most of your components will be entirely presentational and the logic will live outside the components except for a few so-called &quot;containers&quot; which are just extremely thin wrappers.<p>So with React+Redux you then have your component structure living in React components and your logic living in a few functions that describe transitions of the immutable application state plus a few &quot;containers&quot; that just describe how the state is applied to the API of the few &quot;smart&quot; components that actually need interaction.<p>Sure, HTML strings intuitively <i>feel</i> more appropriate for describing these components and Web Components definitely look more &quot;HTML-like&quot; in that regard, but at the end of the day you&#x27;re still writing something XML-like with made up elements (whether they&#x27;re Web Components or React &quot;components&quot;) that needs to be processed by JavaScript before being turned into the actual DOM.<p>--<p>One major change React brings to the table that isn&#x27;t spoken nearly as much of as it should be is that React can be used to render applications to HTML, without the DOM, on the server. This usually gets mentioned in the context of &quot;load times&quot; or &quot;SEO friendliness&quot; but it&#x27;s a pretty significant property of React.<p>Not only can React on the client &quot;seamlessly&quot; re-use the server-rendered DOM and attach itself like a jQuery plugin would but being able to render the application (and using Redux: render it with an arbitrary state) means you can truly embrace the idea of progressive enhancement without giving up the comfort of web application tooling.<p>Some years ago there was a lot of hype (well, not as much by a long stretch but some hype nevertheless) around the idea of making web apps work without JS (YUI[0] allowing server-side rendering of JS web apps and PJAX[1] enabling web sites to behave more like apps). Instead of mucking around with client-side templates you would render pages on the server and then intercept internal links to fetch and inject only the bits that changed between the current page and the next.<p>React+Redux is basically PJAX, but it&#x27;s also the polar oppsite. Instead of rendering everything using server-side technologies, you render everything using client-side technologies. And instead of offloading re-renders to the server you keep them in the client when possible (where they can be further optimised thanks to DOM diffing).<p>Let me restate that: React+Redux allows you to build &quot;Rich Internet Applications&quot; in a way that makes it possible to support JavaScript-free fallbacks out of the box. There&#x27;s nothing stopping developers from making the HTML output of their React apps richly semantic and accessible either (even though that represents the Eternal War of the web).<p>The idea is not new[2] but with React it&#x27;s not only achievable but <i>easily</i> achievable. And unlike Web Components it only needs existing technologies that are widely supported (it even works in IE8).<p>--<p>The PandaStrike article you linked is not a rebuttal of React. It&#x27;s a rebuttal of traditional client-side web applications. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether they are built with Angular or Backbone or React -- the arguments are mostly universal. The difference is that React is the only option today that (despite not having HTML &quot;templates&quot;) allows developers to do something smarter.<p>Of course React is a land grab. <i>Every</i> open source project is. But it&#x27;s not an attack on the Open Web anymore than jQuery was an attack on the Open Web before querySelectorAll or XMLHttpRequest landed in a spec. That you&#x27;re no longer writing straight-up HTML in a text file doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re no better off than if you were using GWT[3].<p>And who says Web Components are the Right Choice just because they&#x27;re becoming part of the native platform? Sometimes the thing we think we want[4] isn&#x27;t what we really need[5], even if it&#x27;s on track to become a standard.<p>--<p>[0] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ajaxian.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;server-side-rendering-with-yui-on-node-js"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ajaxian.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;server-side-rendering-with-yui-o...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pjax.herokuapp.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pjax.herokuapp.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stevesouders.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;30&#x2F;render-first-js-second&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stevesouders.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;30&#x2F;render-first-js-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwtproject.org&#x2F;gettingstarted.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwtproject.org&#x2F;gettingstarted.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;readwrite.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;object-observe-javascript-api-impact"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;readwrite.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;object-observe-javascript-ap...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;object-observe-withdrawn"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;object-observe-withdrawn</a>",Facebook

2015-11-01 20:52:32,Ask HN: How do you manage cross-system dependencies?,"Thanks for explaining.  This is a pain point I think everyone that does service oriented architecture has to some level.<p>Most shops I have worked in seem to mostly attack this via procedure.  Ie - release is OK&#x27;d by QA, then deploy ticket is made that specifies what versions go where, and then operations is responsible for executing this procedure and ensuring its sanity.<p>If you have a lot of hands in the pot, (too many cooks), then this is bound to have issues when everyone is busy and things get overlooked.<p>There is a lot of automation that can help however.  Dependency management in this sense I think has to be more elaborate than just &quot;is X installed or deployed&quot;, but you might also want to ask &quot;is X healthy?&quot;  Just because a package has been installed doesn&#x27;t mean its working.<p>So that is in my opinion why there is no one-size-fits-all solution for this.  Many releases are fully compatible with each other, and in simple applications probably even more so, but once you have many teams working on many services, it can be a nightmare.<p>A lot of places have granular feature management.  So, frontend can fail gracefully if feature is not supported on backend.  Often backend supports more than 1 fronted version set.  You can use versioned api&#x27;s (like putting a version in an http header, or namespacing features like &#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;x, &#x2F;api&#x2F;v2&#x2F;x).  (it&#x27;s been said a huge distributed app like facebook has something like 500 different versions of components all running concurrently)<p>You can have your deployment automation do things like check to see if backend has required version (which would be something that you would have to put in hiera&#x2F;equiv of what versions are required), and even more importantly if they are responding to health checks.<p>One project I currently work on has a very distributed architecture, and every application has to conform to a health check endpoint that returns its state and its version.  So we have scripts that do either rolling deploys or green&#x2F;blue deploys depending on what we are deploying, and we can define the order in which services are deployed.  We can deploy them concurrently&#x2F;rolling, or independent&#x2F;rolling, or either of those flavors non-rolling, or green&#x2F;blue.<p>So if we say we are deploying fronted3.1, backend4.2, and we are replacing frontend3.0 and backend 4.1, this would be seen by the deploy scripts (and operations team) as a single changeset for the environment.  So if frontend3.1 needed backend4.1 to function, we would specify a independent rolling deployment, so for each service thats being deployed (starting with the backend), we would roll out server by server at a specified interval, and we would wait for that server to return a healthy health check with the specified version.  If this fails the deploy is rolled back and notifications are sent.<p>^ with this working correctly, we have to have the understanding with the application developers that we will never release a backend that is not backwards compatible with any components that rely on this. (beyond a cutoff version, which those do exist too)<p>In practice this works quite well, but is not magic, and definitely requires some up front development of automation.<p>So, sorry for the long post, I think this is a long winded way of saying, my opinion is that this belongs in a configuration management, as the logic encapsulating &quot;what version goes where&quot; gets more complex over time, and so some code, logic, decision making, and failsafes all have to be carefully thought out.",Facebook

Basically a microphone soldered together from parts and hung on a wardrobe, + some Microsoft Speech API based software I wrote for off-line command recognition and control over a WinAMP instance. It wasn&#x27;t that hard to get it working even though the music was on the loudspeakers, with quite high a volume setting.<p>I could use it to change the music from my bed, or chair, or anywhere in the room. Did it made me exercise less? No. I actually did it to stop myself turning the computer screen on to change music while doing math exercises for maturity exam. It helped me to keep focused, because the task suddenly didn&#x27;t require to do a context switch. Since that experience, it&#x27;s how I see home automation - as a way to reduce context switching and to streamline some chores, not to rob you of meaningful activities.",Facebook

2015-10-08 11:31:58,"Show HN: Squatmon, a domain squatting monitoring system, with new things","Hi HN<p>a lot has changed since our last Show HN, and i guess it was time to share these change with you.<p>for those who weren&#x27;t here the first time, we try to catch domain squatting using a bunch of techniques we already used when doing it manually, but in a purely automated fashion. your root domain (think &#x27;facebook&#x27;, &#x27;twitter&#x27;, &#x27;ycombinator&#x27;, etc...) gets through blenders that generate variants, that we&#x27;ll gather info on.<p>we now have all the basics in place so i can confidently call it production ready. free accounts are still the same deal, one domain, five TLDs, all present and future generators, whois and dns resolver, plus a few more still in the oven, and one run per week, which should be enough if your needs are not massive and&#x2F;or specific.
you also now have paying options for people with more intensive needs, either timing wise (down to one run per day, and one run per 4 hours will be a possibility once i&#x27;m confident 1: we can handle it, 2: it can actually provide value in the real world) or number-of-tlds-wise.<p>notifications! yeap i know it&#x27;s basic, but we now send you a mail when a run is complete, so you don&#x27;t have to bother reloading waiting for that progress bar to reach 100%. a few client asked us about sms notification, but i&#x27;m not sure about multiple notification channels yet.<p>so what&#x27;s next :<p>we have a bunch of stuff that stayed on the backburner while i was working on making the production as autonomous as possible (complete CI&#x2F;CD stack, built with chef, openstack heat, jenkins, the whole shebang) and the other dev was working on ironing the kinks
existing when interacting with horrible protocols like whois (for the sake of everyone&#x27;s sanity, i really hope rdap (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.rdap.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.rdap.org&#x2F;</a>) gets traction) or misbehaving dns, or just plain old bugs. we&#x27;re now bringing them back on the front of the workbench.<p>parking detection.<p>this one is simple, and everybody will get it, but i noticed a large number of parked domains in resolution runs, so they&#x27;ll be marked as such.<p>automated phishing detection.<p>this has been a major demand so i&#x27;m prototyping a CV system (ab)using ghost.py and opencv to see if i can get something that has a reasonable false positive rate.<p>malware detection.<p>a smaller demand because it&#x27;s already well covered by other products. for the moment paying accounts get access to google safebrowsing, and i have a bunch of threat exchange APIs access ready to enter the quorum. there&#x27;s a lot of datasharing between those, so i don&#x27;t want to generate false positives because of data sharing. i have also been working slowly on PR for cuckoo sandbox that&#x27;ll help me launch fleets of sandboxes in various configuration (hopefully i&#x27;ll have enough variants that the client is able to more or less choose the one that correspond to its production environment to try and catch targeted attacks)<p>keyword prediction based on the root domain.<p>we have a keyword generator that can generate domain variants, think &#x27;cheap-brand&#x27; for &#x27;brand&#x27;, but if you&#x27;re like me you probably can&#x27;t think of a lot of those (i had good success asking marketing guys for ideas). once again AI to the rescue, i&#x27;m tracking which keywords had the most &#x27;success&#x27; in finding resolving variants, which means once i&#x27;m able to establish lexical domains i&#x27;ll be able to offer everyone a &#x27;most likely keyword for this domain&#x27; help to feed the generator.<p>an API!<p>at the very beginning, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and the iphone 5s the cool product of the year, squatmon was just a very large and very ugly python script i used in various recon engagements. as we decided to slap a shiny web interface on it and share it with others, we didn&#x27;t take the time to make an API the first class citizen and the web interface just the reference client implementation.

The client can pick and choose which of the exposed attributes it needs to render a view. So if you have, say, a user profile page, you might use relay to declare that you need something like:<p><pre><code>    user(id: $userId) {
      username
      age
    }
</code></pre>
Then relay will hit your graphql server and add this data to your react props.<p>It&#x27;s a similar thing with mutations - you expose operations through your server and then relay handles calling it with the necessary data, and propagating back the response into the UI.<p>I&#x27;ve found this approach to be very powerful and quick to develop in (once I got my head around it). With REST, you have to keep on adding new endpoints or fiddling with your server if you need more attributes from it. E.g. say you also want the user&#x27;s gender. With traditional REST you&#x27;d need to make this change in your client (to request that extra data) and update your server to expose it. Or perhaps you&#x27;d add a new endpoint that returned more data about a user. Then you may also need to decide what happens with legacy clients. Should they fail if they receive extra, unexpected data, or do you version your API, etc.?<p>With GraphQL you can choose to expose all of the different attributes on your user model (with authentication&#x2F;authorisation, etc as appropriate) in-advance, and then if clients need the gender, they can just request it via relay.<p>After I tried writing an app using REST and continually feeling like I was walking in mud, this is a real breath of fresh air, and I feel productive again. I definitely recommend checking it out.",Facebook

Women can do the same with a safer Twitter and Facebook - if they want. It&#x27;s never been easier to do so, with Kickstarter and other funding options.<p>Women are not a minority - they are over 50% of the population, and more than capable of solving problems like this, again, if they want. Apparently things were bad enough in dating for Bumble, but since there isn&#x27;t a female-oriented Twitter or Facebook, I suspect the problems are overstated on those sites.",Facebook
2015-09-15 02:46:30,GraphQL: A data query language,"Version Free sounds amazing - I can see the pros of being able to add&#x2F;deprecate fields at the same API endpoint, but I find most of the reason we version our API is for field type changes as the data schema naturally evolves.

Now homePlanet goes from being a String to a Planet { name population } object.<p>This type change would break existing clients - the only real solution I can think of is introducing the planet object as PlanetDetails (essentially PlanetV2) and deprecating planet, but that&#x27;s just back to versioning.<p>I feel like there must be a better way to deal with it? Interestingly, the graphql format allows this to be differentiated (as the old API won&#x27;t request an object), but there appears to be no provision to union two non-objects into a single field?",Facebook

Which is a good thing, given how many permissions Facebook&#x27;s app requires.  Apparently this was announced back in April, but I just noticed it, due to Facebook being updated: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;reaching-and-re-engaging-users-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;reaching-and-re-engaging-us...</a><p>Along with other things such as the app manifest, Chrome on Android is leading the pack in terms of making the mobile web feel native. Previously this title belonged to iOS Safari, unfortunately Apple dropped the ball a long time ago.<p>I&#x27;ve been a long time Firefox user and I&#x27;m using Firefox on Android as well. But I do think they could do a better job, I mean I&#x27;m all for Firefox OS and what that means for Mozilla, but I feel their Android effort is subpar and that&#x27;s a shame, given that Android is the modern Windows and there&#x27;s plenty of room for Firefox on it. I mean right now Firefox is the only app I have that wasn&#x27;t updated for the material design guidelines and they didn&#x27;t even try to fake it. And that would be OK, but I&#x27;ve been waiting for things to get fixed ever since forever, like the Add to Homescreen functionality which is completely broken.<p>But anyway, people that bemoan web interfaces are usually ignorant of present day web interfaces that people use.<p>You can&#x27;t name an email client that&#x27;s more usable than GMail&#x27;s web interface. And surprisingly FastMail on a mobile browser is almost as usable as native GMail, being all web. Facebook and Google Maps are 2 other example of having awesome mobile web interfaces. Of course, people focus on shiny rather than utility. But I don&#x27;t care how usable or shiny your iMessenger or your FaceTime is, because I don&#x27;t own an iOS device, not anymore. And your native app might be great, but if it doesn&#x27;t have a web presence, I personally don&#x27;t care much about it because I change devices often.",Facebook

It is based on React [1] and SwarmJS [2] and primarily intended for embedding into applications to support rich text entry with real-time collaboration. Technically, it works similarly to Google Docs and eschews ContentEditable in favor of a custom javascript-based editor surface and layout engine [3]. As far as I know, this is the first open source implementation of this technique. Please see the project README and source code [4] for more details. Note that this is pretty new and hasn&#x27;t seen any real-world testing&#x2F;usage, so there are some known bugs [5] and likely lots of unknown ones as well.<p>Depending on interest, I am considering offering the editor as a software-as-a-service solution. Because it is intended for real-time collaboration, a server-side component is (currently) required. While a simple implementation is part of the open source project, a more complete commercial service could handle storage, communications, security, availability, and provide a simple but powerful API for developers. The API would allow interaction with client-side editors and the data they contain, including real-time server-side push updates as editor contents change. Please let me know if your company or startup may be interested in such a service.<p><pre><code>  [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;

2015-08-17 16:39:46,Eve Version 0,"&gt; <i>In order to accomplish that, we do need a way to describe processes. We need a way to &quot;program.&quot; But switching the goal from building applications to analyzing and communicating information changes everything. Our current programming tools are awful thinking tools. Instead, they were designed to build complex systems. How much effort does it take to write a program to scan through your facebook friends and check to see if someone who usually isn&#x27;t in your area currently is?...People aren&#x27;t really tring to build the next Facebook, they&#x27;re trying to use the information from it in a different way.</i><p>The example given here by the OP strikes me as a good example of how and why programming is complicated, and what people generally <i>want</i> their programs to do is unlikely to be doable without knowing how to program.<p>Case in point: why can&#x27;t a layperson just make a little app &quot;to scan through your facebook friends and check to see if someone who usually isn&#x27;t in your area currently is&quot;? The ease, glib answer is: well, Facebook&#x27;s developer API requires several hoops to jump through, including OAuth of clients and so forth. So that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no drag-and-drop-plug-and-play module system for such a feature.<p>The bigger answer is the answer to the question of why does Facebook&#x27;s API have to be so complicated? Well, besides business reasons...FB&#x27;s API is a public-facing abstraction over a system in which a billion people have agreed to (semi-)authenticate themselves and communicate a variety of real-time things about themselves. As annoying as it is to program your own little FB apps...it&#x27;s complicated because the system it interfaces with is overwhelmingly and amazingly complicated.<p>I don&#x27;t see much room for improvement in making programming easier in this regard.

2015-08-02 15:48:53,"Ask HN: Does disrupt mean unnerve established player, so player must buy you?","There&#x27;s a weird period during things that appear truly disruptive where the established player may try to buy you. This happens when it becomes clear there&#x27;s a non-zero chance that the established player may quickly become extinct because of the new player&#x27;s growth, however it is still not inevitable. Lately, the most prominent examples of this have come with Facebook&#x27;s successful and failed acquisitions. For example:<p>Instagram in Apr. 2012: Facebook is about photos, but it wasn&#x27;t crushing mobile like it is today. Instagram was, but it still wasn&#x27;t clear whether Instagram&#x27;s growth would top out or what monetization would look like. Facebook made a $1bn offer that many thought was crazy, but Instagram is now worth (by many estimates) 30-50x that.<p>ON THE OTHER HAND:<p>Snapchat ~Nov 2013: Snapchat pioneered an entirely new way to interact with photos on a phone - another existential crisis for Facebook. Facebook offers $3bn in cash. To an extent FAR greater than when Zuck made the offer to Instagram, people were aligned in saying Evan S should take the offer. Snapchat, after all, in many people&#x27;s minds was about sexting and distasteful things - take the money. Growth would top out eventually, people would get over it. Evan, however, disagreed - Snapchat wasn&#x27;t mostly used for sexting, it was used for sharing moments. And it was working, and in fact it had become inevitable to him. Zuck went through the same thing getting offers from Yahoo and Microsoft at Facebook, and he was right. Evan, FWIW, I think is also right - Snapchat is going to change the game.",Facebook
2015-07-28 22:18:19,"As Tech Booms, Workers Turn to Coding for Career Change","While I&#x27;m sure it helps to be a math major anywhere, anyone who has been trained to be a careful analytic thinker would be a good candidate to become a programmer. For instance if you were a humanities major from a school with a strong academic reputation and you actually took your coursework seriously as an undergrad.<p>As much as programming is applied math, most companies are not Google or Facebook and have problems that can suffer the inefficiency of a non-expert. A lot of programming jobs ask you to get data from a form or API, do something with it and show some HTML. And that HTML needs to be styled in CSS and have some neat UI elements that are fine tuned in Javascript. There is nothing about that kind of work that favors a math major over English major.<p>The situation changes if your company is huge, handling thousands of requests a second so small inefficiencies add up and are wasteful on a large scale or even cause the software to break entirely. But assuming you have a smart CTO&#x2F;Lead you should know where potential pain points in your code are and still be able to hire a relatively inexperienced junior and get good work out of that person. I have a friend who was an Ivy CS grad, worked at Google then worked at Squarespace. He said he was intimidated by designers who knew HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript and were good with forms because a lot of work for developers could be handled as quickly by those type of developers as he could handle it with his vastly more technical background.",Facebook
2015-07-21 18:58:29,Why I am pro-GPL,"The first half of the article was good and balanced. I especially like the distinction in lay terms: copyleft to push freedom; non-copyleft to push adoption. That&#x27;s a great way to describe it to a person contemplating what license to choose. Then, the article goes in a different direction that embodies negative qualities that author critiqued in the related presentation. Let&#x27;s address a bit of this from my pro-consumer, pro-security&#x2F;quality, pro-OSS, anti-copyleft perspective. Mentioned that just so my bias is clear upfront and why I push adoption-oriented licenses (esp for open hardware &amp; high assurance).<p>re stepping stone. Yes, this is the common goal of proprietary use of anti-copyleft software. IIRC, copyleft software got its start using the architecture, languages, tools, and platforms of BSD and proprietary offerings. So, even GPL proponents build on existing work. Anyone wanting an open, free version of a given enhancement can similarly produce it starting with the same stepping stones.<p>re open to closed. We saw this happen with Apple App Store, the QNX source reversal, attempts to combine open code with DRM, and so on. This is bad. However, it almost exclusively happens with companies whose licensing, TOS&#x27;s, SLA&#x27;s, etc allow for this sort of thing. That&#x27;s where the problem is. Avoiding such companies, selecting safest licenses, and&#x2F;or ensuring certain conditions are perpetual in contracts&#x2F;licenses are easiest solution. GPL is actually a successful implementation of my claim, although it wasn&#x27;t good enough. Affero corrected a major deficiency and more evolutions will probably follow. Many more licensing schemes can happen to reduce negative impact of business participation while empowering users.<p>The common theme in most gripes is what the companies do. The reason we have this problem is that users almost exclusively do business with scumbag companies. They don&#x27;t care about terms. They don&#x27;t care about its ethics. Prior abuses rarely make them change companies (see Microsoft and Facebook). They don&#x27;t try to leverage their buying power to force (existing) or incentivize (startups) companies to negotiate something that&#x27;s favorable to them and future-proof in main risk areas. Like the old saying, the only thing that was necessary for triumph of evil was that good people did nothing [while evil kept its eye on the ball and its hands&#x2F;feet in a sprint].<p>A lot of these problems can be avoided by simply investing in the right organizations. People who pick up Microsoft&#x27;s server operating system are in for more schemes than those that used FreeBSD with commercial support. Certain small companies behind IDE&#x27;s and libraries have had <i>great</i> terms for their users for years with minimal hassles unlike the mess that&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s development tools. Services provided by non-profits, cooperatives, and companies simply focused on customer satisfaction have done great compared to race to bottom in cost or highest shareholder earnings that get many others scheming on customers. Pick the right people&#x2F;companies&#x2F;tools, maintain an out to avoid lock-in (open formats&#x2F;API&#x27;s help), and invest in that. Double down on it if they use permissive licenses and re-invest back into their communities.<p>In the end, this is more a problem of incentives than purely a legal one. People trust companies that don&#x27;t care about them. They get screwed. Stop doing that. Do plenty more of the opposite. On top of it, explore alternatives [1] to popular source-sharing models in case business opportunities arise. Get momentum going in directions other than companies that do lock-in and lock-down. After all, I&#x27;ve done a lot of business with proprietary companies and have mostly avoided being boxed in. Same goes for FOSS use. Imagine that... All about what you use, how, and from whom. Sacrifices will need to be made, though, and now we&#x27;re getting back to user demand (incentives) driving the negative practices.<p>Outside a niche, I don&#x27;t see it happening because market as a whole won&#x27;t take responsibility to make it happen. The problems are market&#x27;s fault, as usual. Good that niche commercial, OSS, and FOSS have given us plenty of good stuff to work with. I encourage all of them to keep at it without a need to fight with any. I avoid GPL strictly for economic reasons: certain investments don&#x27;t happen, esp high assurance or ASIC development, unless they can recover the cost somehow. Additionally, companies adopting high quality components makes stuff more robust over time. Finally, making money allows them to fight inevitable patent suits that will attempt to put them out of business and create more patents for defensive use. So, for economic reasons, I oppose the GPL in some spaces while respecting it and being neutral in others. My OS is GPL, for instance, and I&#x27;m grateful to its developers &amp; community. :)<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;friday_squid_bl_424.html#c6051639"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;friday_squid_...</a>",Facebook
2015-07-19 17:54:18,The self-hating web developer,"Where do you think the most successful web apps (like Slack recently) are emerging?  From the SV echo chamber.<p>To be a talented full-stack web application developer for a <i>successful</i> consumer facing app, you sort of need to have an obsession with UI&#x2F;UX design trends.  Finished web apps that delight customers have an attention to detail that put them over the edge into the realm of being successful.<p>What you need to learn to become a <i>top</i> web app developer is actually punishingly brutal.  People now expect all web apps to operate with the smoothness of having AJAX everywhere that you see with apps like Youtube, Gmail and Facebook. Web app developers who can actually build web apps to that level of quality are extremely valuable.<p>Web development is not easy if you really specialize in it. By that I mean people who have really accumulated best practices and knowledge over common core problems of the web.  These are the people who within a month can return you an app fully loaded with user accounts, multi-tenancy, notifications, emails, subscriptions, the ability to upload documents, search, credit card payments, google maps, API gateways, chats etc.<p>In addition to having programming chops, a lot of their value actually comes from having spent time collecting good &quot;widgets&quot; of useful software they can use for new projects.  These &quot;widgets&quot; allow them to build impressive experiences quickly. Examples include having an opinion about what a &quot;joyride tour&quot; javascript widget looks like, having an opinion about what makes a good date-time picker, mastering form validation, -- the list is nearly endless, but they all come down to the person having an informed opinion about what UI&#x2F;UX paradigms are best from a human-computer interaction perspective, and knowing that these paradigms change quickly.  A person who I would call an <i>elite</i> (front-end) web developer is somebody who builds their own widgets frequently just to see what works.<p>Such sideskills of a web developer only come from constant learning.  In my opinion it is one of the most brutal sectors of software in terms of how quickly your skills fall out of date and how much you constantly need to be learning in order to remain competitive.",Facebook

For example, the developers of Plume could create a &quot;Plume for Facebook&quot; app and so on, so they end up with a whole family of Plume apps, each one for a different social network.",Facebook

2015-06-06 16:58:31,"Show HN: GraPHP, a PHP graph DB web framework","I’m really excited this was finally shared. A little backstory. This framework is the manifestation of ideas that Mike developed at Mixtent, a startup that produced three products in 2 years and eventually got acquired by Facebook.<p>The biggest advantage this framework has over other more traditional ones like RoR or Django is being able to model product ideas as a graph in code abstractions. This enables product engineers to rapidly prototype ideas (no need to interact with the DB), and jump into features built by other engineers (the node-edge API is standardized).<p>While the first product Mixtent built used more traditional django-style models, it resulted in features that became hard to manage over time. Each model had its own DB table and making changes was painful. The next two were built using a similar graph framework on top of CodeIgniter, and the benefits to prototyping speed and ease-of-understanding were visibly felt by all engineers (including myself).",Facebook
2015-06-05 17:39:12,Ask HN: Does a college degree hold more power than a strong portfolio?,"I see it this way: it&#x27;s a choice between being mostly a craftsmen&#x2F;engineer and being an applied scientist (that can also become a very good craftsmen&#x2F;engineer).<p>If you want to limit yourself to jobs that need only concrete skills, specific knowledge (e.g. knowing an API of some framework inside or out, or even knowing the nits and grits of a specific programming language) then a strong portfolio, and self learning might be enough. Although you will always be looked down upon by CS college grad peers once big O and Algorithms &#x2F; data structures discussions are coming up. Even if you know it better than them! (They just assume that you don&#x27;t as you don&#x27;t have a degree)<p>But the bigger downside if you truly choose to be solely a craftsmen is that you always have to keep up or your are out. Technologies change, and if you don&#x27;t change with them, you are obsolete. Even if you know HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Rails to the level you memorized them and have built an impressive portfolio with 2000 stars in GitHub and 10 HN front page submissions. Ask yourself where is that guy who did this 10 years ago? I was one of those, I had Flash stuff that was the equivalent to the above. Got Macromedia site of the day, people in forums and myspace praised my work, I got my work presented in FlashForward conferences. 
Does it worth anything now? zip, nada. think 10-15 years from now. will a starred github JQuery plugin you wrote get you that job when you are 35? 45? 55?<p>In the other hand, if you want transferable skills that are not framework related, you need to either self learn it, (which is hard to prove) or get a degree. the degree serves the following:<p>10% - the actual knowledge (you can get it anywhere), 40% - the self discipline structure that forces you to &quot;self learn&quot;. think of it as a challenge, you pay tuition, they force you to stay focused and self learn by going to lectures &#x2F; watching them online. 30% - is the easy verification that you know those things, instead of reading your portfolio and looking for usage of data structures &#x2F; algorithms (e.g. anything that is not just &quot;trade skills&quot; or &quot;craftsmanship&quot;, future employers can just see your degree, and assume (if you got a decent GPA and it&#x27;s a decent university) that you got that at least covered. 
the last 20% is as others said - soft skills implied from graduating college. employers know that you can handle life on your own, handle deadlines, handle working with a team, handle pressure, and do something that is not immediate gratification.<p>You can always choose to also be a craftsman after you get your degree, in practice, specific technical skills are very important and valuable for employers.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to limit the jobs you can apply for, you need to prove 2 things -<p>1) that you have your CS basics (Algorithms,  Data Structures etc) otherwise you rule out many interesting jobs (not just at Google &#x2F; Facebook, but also many web startups that need more than just CRUD &#x2F; web &#x2F; mobile)<p>2) that you can actually code and use that knowledge in a specific tech stack.<p>You can prove #2 easily by going the portfolio way. 
You make it harder to prove #1 by going the portfolio way, and make it easier by going the degree way.<p>p.s. you can get a CS top 10 US education for about $10,000<p>Step 1: get an accredited US CS undergrad degree online for $4,000 at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uopeople.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uopeople.edu</a><p>Step 2: apply to Georgia Tech Online Master of Science (degree is the same as on-campus degree, which is ranked #9 in the US for Graduate Computer Science degree) and pay only about $6,600 and you don&#x27;t need a GRE! (as opposed to the on campus one). you just need to get B and above in 2 core courses to be fully admitted (not always easy, but doable)<p>The amount of jobs you can do after that grows largely. And I think it will be a little more interesting than just doing the same old CRUD &#x2F; Mobile &#x2F; UI until you retire, and having to learn every 10 years or so a whole new paradigm.<p>Just think of all the build tools, frameworks that there are out there, you are a Grunt + Node + Angular guru today, tomorrow they will look for a Gulp + TypeScript + React guru, and in 10 years OO GUI building will make a comeback and people will return to writing UI using Swing &#x2F; MFC like structure as you can run it natively in a browser using ASM.js.<p>I&#x27;m doing web since 2000, and the amount of technology changes is overwhelming, what is hype today, might not be even in existence 10-15 years from now.<p>Programming principles, (OO, Functional, Reactive etc) and basic CS stuff (Algorithms, Data Structures) will likely stay here a little longer.

Yeah, a cheaper VR headset pricepoint is nice, but not if you&#x27;re just unloading all the expensive components onto the buyer via a $1200+ PC purchase. Not to mention, as someone who suffers with motion sickness with traditional games, how will the Oculus work for me? Have they solved this riddle? Will they ever?<p>This is also why I see Sony having great success with its Morpheus headset. The PS4 is cheap as-is ($399) and if you already own one, its a no-brainer to go with their product. I&#x27;d be really surprised if Oculus ever goes mainstream. It still looks like an uber-nerds hobbyist toy like a, say, 3D printer, which technophiles have been telling us for years would be mainstream by now and in &quot;every kitchen.&quot;<p>Carmack isn&#x27;t stupid. He didn&#x27;t sell to Zuck because he thought he&#x27;d be moving 10&#x27;s of millions of product every year. He sold to Zuck because he knew that the shipping date doesn&#x27;t really change things for Oculus. Its still a very rough road to mainstream acceptance and economic competitiveness.  I can afford $299 for the headset, but I&#x27;m not interested in buying a super gaming box to make it work. Nor am I interested in being a beta tester for a technology known to be a bit wonky, cause motion sickness, have questionable 3rd party support, and Facebook ownership&#x2F;integration&#x2F;driver and API&#x27;s TOS.<p>This is what on top of what Valve is doing, which may just steal Carmack&#x27;s thunder as they have everything they need to make this work: the store, no relationship with unrelated businesses like social networking, large customer base, community goodwill, game publisher relationships, a decade plus in the game selling world, etc. If both the Valve set and the Oculus set go for $299, I can&#x27;t think of any reason to even consider the Oculus.",Facebook

And several businesses have recently closed because they did just that.<p>LinkedIn claims this change is because they want to have the best end-user experience.  Well - I think the main reason I have a professional graph is because I want to leverage my connections.  And frankly, LinkedIn&#x27;s use of that graph info is primarily focused on Finding Jobs and building Social Capital for your career.<p>By cutting off developers from the graph and community - I think Linkedin is actually NOT providing a better end-user experience... for other apps - LinkedIn is now a glorified Professional Resume served up via an API.  BUT as a LinkedIn user I want to leverage my graph in different ways - reconnecting with old connections, keeping track of people&#x27;s careers, connecting with vendors, and other use cases I can&#x27;t imagine - but other app developers can.<p>As usual, I know nothing will change LinkedIn&#x27;s mind.

2015-04-05 23:32:59,I won't be using Angular for my next projectand neither should you,"Overall, I like what Angular v1 does and how easy it is to be productive in it - I have helped save multiple companies&#x27; products (medium-sized codebases) because Angular can be extremely quick to iterate on top of and gives you so many tools for that productivity, while unit testing much of it (although the unit testing situation is not quite perfect).<p>I like using Angular relative to Backbone and Ember, although my experience with Ember was last a year ago, and the framework has progressed a lot since then. I like React over Angular 1 currently, especially since it supports robust server-side rendering solutions. React takes some ideas from Angular such as not being opinionated with the models, but makes writing the core of its components much nicer than Angular 1&#x27;s directives. It also does not take much opinions over the service architecture, which also makes me happy, but the tradeoff is that it leaves a lot of developers in the dark as far as how to organize code with it - that is why Facebook pushed the Flux pattern very strongly.<p>Angular 2 definitely took a lot of React&#x27;s good points and integrated them in better ways into Angular 2, or have plans to integrate them. Ideas such as supporting immutable data, virtual DOM (well, at least something similar to virtual DOM anyhow), and unidirectional data flow make their way into Angular 2. Robust dependency injection (no more using $inject or the hacky array syntax for DI) and better API for creating components come as more evolutionary changes from Angular 1. The declarative templates are also a lot simpler, as expression support is more limited than the broad JavaScript-like syntax supported in Angular 1. Shadow DOM being a first class citizen of the framework makes having to worry about component CSS being clobbered a problem of yesterday.<p>Overall, I am excited as a frontend developer - there are a lot of exciting things happening in the frontend world, and the ecosystem is maturing by leaps and bounds.",Facebook

2015-02-27 07:06:26,“Implement text editor DOM updates manually instead of via React”,"For context, here&#x27;s a discussion from the Atom forum that we had way back in August about the future of React in Atom:<p><a href=""https://discuss.atom.io/t/whats-the-status-of-react-in-atom/11456"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.atom.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;whats-the-status-of-react-in-atom&#x2F;...</a><p>There are a few issues in play here:<p>(1) Atom wants to support a world in which every Atom package can install whatever version of a dependency it wants, including React. This is very common in Node (incidentally, this causes problems if you want to use singletons or instanceof in Node), but fairly uncommon on the Web (where React is primarily used). That is, it&#x27;s rare that you inadvertently load multiple versions of React in your single-page application. If you did, you would likely get an error when adding one React component as a child of another React component because of the way React vends ids. (Solutions are possible, but none is employed today.)<p>From Atom&#x27;s perspective, that is a problem. The only way they can work around it is by providing &quot;one true version of React&quot; with Atom core that all packages must use, but then Atom is forcing all packages to use a particular version of React. That would violate Atom&#x27;s philosophy of letting each package choose its own dependencies.<p>(2) This is not just an issue for React, but for any UI toolkit whose components are not guaranteed to interoperate across versions. To sidestep this issue, Atom has currently decided to use the DOM API&#x2F;HTML custom elements. I would call this the &quot;least common denominator approach,&quot; which satisfies Atom&#x27;s design goals, but fails to provide a higher-level abstraction for building UI in Atom. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>(3) React does not currently support the shadow DOM or custom attributes, which is the new direction that Atom has chosen. As React has not yet been evicted from Atom core, I recently upstreamed a change (<a href=""https://github.com/atom/react/pull/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;atom&#x2F;react&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1</a>) to add one-off support for Atom&#x27;s primary custom elements, &lt;atom-text-editor mini&gt; and &lt;atom-panel&gt;, in the fork of React bundled with Atom. As I develop Atom packages using babel (formerly 6to5) <a href=""http://blog.atom.io/2015/02/04/built-in-6to5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.atom.io&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;04&#x2F;built-in-6to5.html</a>, which has default support for JSX, building UI in React has been a lot of fun. However, the lack of support for custom attributes makes it difficult to do things like add an appropriate onChange handler to an &lt;atom-text-editor&gt; to update the React component&#x27;s state as shown in <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;docs&#x2F;forms.html</a>.<p>(4) React is still version 0.x.x, which means it has not yet committed to a stable API. This makes choosing a version of React to bundle with Atom an even more uncomfortable decision for the Atom team, assuming they were willing to do so in the first place.<p>None of these items implies that there is something fundamentally broken about React&#x27;s model. It just means that the React team has some work to do in order to support Atom&#x27;s use case. The performance graphs cited in the original post are also significant (and of interest to the React team), but even if the performance problems were fixed tomorrow, that alone would probably not be enough for Atom to pull React back into core right now.",Facebook
2015-02-25 19:42:46,PGP: There’s Life in the Old Dog Yet,"Which is why I proposed that UI: it works automatically. While using the system, it simply indicates to you as you compose the message &quot;Yes, the email address you are sending mail to belongs to the person you intend to message&quot; or &quot;No, that email address belongs to someone else&quot; or &quot;This is a brand new email address.&quot; This way when you are emailing your lawyer to set up a will, or you email your accountant with your tax info, you can be sure that (a) you are emailing just the right person and (b) that only they can read the communication.<p>While setting up the system, you are simply required to link your identity. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, GMail, HN, the government all should allow you to easily link your identity. This should be a normal part of your account creation (this can tie in nicely with another change: getting rid of passwords and using a browser UI for identifying yourself a la Persona, but PGP based).  Basically when signing up for Twitter, it should optionally let you upload one of your public keys (via a nice browser UI no less). Twitter (Facebook, GMail, etc.) would then expose a nice API for querying by public key fingerprint: &quot;Who has 0xDEADBEEF?&quot; =&gt; &quot;@DeadBeef&quot;. Revocation, key updates, all that should be automatic: you revoke your public key and issue a replacement, all your services update automatically.<p>This is the point where lots of people will raise concerns about privacy: &quot;This means Twitter now must have access to my GMail account! WTF?!&quot;. No. This process must be voluntary and optional. If you want to have 200 different identities online, go for it. I don&#x27;t care to know your real name, I just care to know that I am talking only to the person I intend to talk to. Think emailing a well known developer on GitHub, having never met them. You don&#x27;t need their real name, you are only interested in them in so far as they publish OSS on GitHub. This allows you to prove that github.com&#x2F;example is @example on Twitter, example@example.com, example@gmail.com, and HN user &quot;example&quot;.<p>And the benefit to &quot;regular Joe&quot; is that when he emails his accountant, he can now send his credit card number and SSN without fear of eavesdropping.",Facebook
2015-02-24 13:28:09,Is Blockchain Really the Killer App?,"&gt; There comes a point when it&#x27;s just no longer practical to store the entire blockchain<p>Why would you have to? The point of decentralisation is not that everyone has a copy of the truth. It&#x27;s that a sufficient number of nodes have a copy of the truth, such that you can check a number of them and easily verify the veracity of the data. Many blockchain applications run not by querying their own blockchain but rather querying a number of trusted sources via their API. Coinbase, Bitpay, Chain.com, Blockcypher etc all offer APIs to interface with their blockchain nodes and others.<p>It&#x27;s like saying Facebook will never work because you can&#x27;t possible store the worlds&#x27; photos on everyone&#x27;s smartphones. You don&#x27;t have to, Facebook stores it on their server. Similarly we will see, and already see, dedicated servers that store the blockchain, and as long as you have enough independent ones you can maintain decentralisation just as if you were hosting your own node.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no need to host the blockchain on small embedded devices any more than any other data, like music or photos we normally host on dedicated servers instead.<p>&gt; but truncating the chain (or only storing some kind of &quot;working set&quot;) isn&#x27;t feasible either.<p>Yes it is. What makes you say it isn&#x27;t? Pruning the blockchain is something that&#x27;s currently being worked on.<p>The idea is that if I send you $1 a million times and you send it back $1m times, every day, for the next 1 billion years, we could either store terabytes and terabytes of data of all these transactions, or we could store the end result (= no change occurred) and the last couple weeks of transaction data. The rest can be pruned. Because each block has a hash of all its transactions, and this hash is used to mine the next block (hence a chain of blocks, blockchain), we needn&#x27;t store each individual transaction, we have the hash to verify the truth of transactions.<p>We might have some universities saving all transactions for posterity &amp; research, and some businesses for data mining, but the vast majorities of nodes that just need to secure the network can indeed, without security issues, not store long-spent outputs. (i.e. bitcoins that have already been spent many times over. e.g. if I give a dollar to you and you give it to the next guy, and he to the next girl, and so on 100 times, at that point there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to store on every node the fact I gave a dollar to you for the security of the network.)<p>&gt; Not to mention the gargantuan download that&#x27;s required for that initial setup to get up to date with the latest network transactions.<p>Again, no need to have all redundant transactions. The pruned blockchain would currently be under a gigabyte large. Second, headers-first has already been implemented which made the initial setup much, much faster.<p>Beyond that, we mustn&#x27;t forget that the average American makes 2 transactions a day. And one such transaction is about 400 bytes or so, in bitcoin. If you compare this to tweets, or an hour of netflix, it&#x27;s puny. If you count up all the data, it&#x27;s about $8 to store one day of all of US consumer transactions on a retail harddrive. Imagine the cost of storage for Mastercard for one of their nodes was $8, and instead of just powering a fraction of US retail, they&#x27;d literally handle every single transaction by themselves and store them all for $8. Even if you wanted to have thousands of nodes and store the last year of data (and given the velocity of money, you wouldn&#x27;t have to as again, you can prune data after money has been spent a couple times), that&#x27;s a puny amount of money to power an entire consumer financial system of the world&#x27;s biggest economy. And given storage, like CPU and bandwidth, on a 50-60% yoy growth rate (Kryders, Moore&#x27;s and Nielsen&#x27;s laws), I think by the time bitcoin becomes important enough to run 100% of US retail (which is likely never, but hypothetically speaking), that $8 will have dropped to below $0.10 easily.<p>I know I&#x27;m taking big shortcuts here but this is just to illustrate the economics are extremely favorable today and in the future. I don&#x27;t know if bitcoin will succeed or fail, but I&#x27;m pretty near certain it won&#x27;t fail because storage&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;bandwidth isn&#x27;t affordable enough for nodes to make it viable to run the network. I and many others have looked into this quite a bit and these aren&#x27;t big problems. Bitcoin has big obstacles (no gigantic consumer benefits in a world of decent fintech like every OECD country to use bitcoin directly, is one), but storage probably isn&#x27;t one of em.",Facebook
2014-12-03 20:55:32,Hacking PayPal Accounts with one click,"I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding this. My mental model of the situation is that websites figure out which user is interacting with them via a &quot;session&quot; cookie, which is only set once the user successfully authenticates. The CSRF &quot;token&quot; is a value associated with this session (that may or may not change on every request) that&#x27;s included with all client-side requests as a way to guarantee that whoever is making the requests is doing so from the site&#x27;s pages. For instance, if I log in to Facebook, then in a new tab open up &#x27;somemalicioussite.com&#x27;, the malicious site might make force my browser to make a request to &#x27;facebook.com&#x2F;some-private-api-endpoint&#x27; to try to figure out who I am. Because it doesn&#x27;t have the CSRF token, it fails.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of using the CSRF token itself to answer the &quot;who is this user&quot; question.

2014-11-20 19:57:12,The Fall of Facebook,"Facebook, the product, is no longer this super sexy app that college kids are checking out. Looking for Facebook to be that, you will probably predict its future demise.<p>But that&#x27;s not what Facebook <i>is</i> anymore. Facebook is the social graph expressed in Internet form, and is so interwoven with the fabric of the Internet that it&#x27;s difficult to avoid, even if you&#x27;re intentionally doing so.<p>Some products phase in and out, that&#x27;s for sure. I think Zuck&#x27;s realized the potential for that to happen, and once he got on the top of the totem pole began preparing for it. He turned FB from an app into a social graph and API that is everywhere, and now he&#x27;s paying from $1B (Instagram) to $19B (WhatsApp) to get some of his biggest would-be enemies to join him. He does not screw around with the Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit I <i>despise</i> my current Facebook feed. It&#x27;s full of clickbait articles mingled with the occasional update from someone whom I may or may not care about. That being said, I have tried to delete Facebook multiple times, and to no avail. I still have my hopes that they&#x27;ll change the algorithm a bit and kill the effectiveness of the clickbait to the same extent they killed the spamminess of those social games and widgets. (Although they still exist and are annoying, they&#x27;re an order of magnitude less annoying than they used to be.) But, despite my best efforts to avoid it, I still check my Facebook feed at least daily.<p>What pulled me back? At first, it was that Facebook was integrated with Spotify. I had to create a new account and build up all of my playlists, songs, etc. from scratch. That was kind of a pain. Then I deleted Facebook again. I ended up missing a party that was <i>only</i> planned on Facebook. Then I missed the news that a friend was engaged, and another friend was pregnant. Then I couldn&#x27;t log into my Kiva account to redistribute the repayments I had received because I had used Facebook to sign up. Facebook is just an incredibly, incredibly sticky product. Network effects are a bitch.<p>Sure, hackers will say, &quot;Well your friends should have called you instead of putting it on Facebook.&quot; But they didn&#x27;t. Even though I&#x27;m not in college, if I&#x27;m not on Facebook I&#x27;m missing the party. (Even though &quot;the party&quot; is now simply knowing that my friend finished med school and is moving to Michigan.)<p>Facebook isn&#x27;t as sexy as it used to be, but it has become increasingly difficult to avoid. Think about that - we have to figure out ways and work hard to <i>avoid</i> a product. That&#x27;s why a significant proportion of the Internet&#x27;s users log in to Facebook <i>every day</i>. Unless some major shift takes place, Facebook isn&#x27;t going anywhere anytime soon.",Facebook

2014-10-25 19:41:18,Angular 2 Core,"Too many unknowns is way too broad of a reason when it comes to JS. JS is already the language of unknowns. It really depends on the framework, timing of things, people behind it. Angular is by Google, but also Google is pushing Web Components at the same time, which can integrate with Angular 2, but it challenges it as well. Also with Angular 2&#x27;s goals being known for a long time, anyone could tell that ES6 would be a dramatic wave of change to the framework.<p>With JS, all the frameworks and libraries out there are just a few years old. Angular is about 5 years old, but Google doesn&#x27;t even use Angular in their sites, which should be extremely telling (along with the complexity learning and figuring out the API). In fact I think Google isn&#x27;t even planning on Angular on any Google sites in the future. They are waiting until Web Components are finalized.<p>With React, it is apparently mature enough, it is used on Facebook (1 billion users), Instagram (a child company of Facebook, like Youtube for Google), Khan Academy, Github (github issue viewer), AirBnB, CloudFlare, and a lot more:<p><a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Sites-Using-React"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;react&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sites-Using-React</a><p>In the JS world, there&#x27;s a lot of reason to keep moving forward with tech. Sure it doesn&#x27;t have to be the latest and greatest, but since JS is such a &quot;poor&quot; language, a lot of these newer tools, features, framework, and libraries help build more professional, quality code.

2014-09-06 22:03:47,There’s Something Rotten in the State of Social Media,"I&#x27;ve said it a lot on HN, but in my opinion, there&#x27;s nothing rotten in the state of social media. Social media itself is inherently rotten.<p>Twitter, Facebook, et al taking away users&#x27; rights, pushing crappy updates and changes, while at the same time using creepy advertising tactics to make money and addictive functionality to keep you involved is Twitter, Facebook et al doing exactly what they were designed to do. Their job is to make their shareholders money by exploiting the people who use their service, and they&#x27;re doing, I&#x27;d say, pretty well.<p>I think Facebook knows full well that nobody likes Facebook Messenger, the newsfeed, the fact their data is never deleted, the obnoxious Zyngames, and so on. They don&#x27;t care. People will use their service anyway and they&#x27;ll make money. Twitter knows people probably wouldn&#x27;t like curated lists, and they&#x27;ll still do it if they think it&#x27;ll make them money (just like they know that developers have no choice but to accept their draconian API terms).<p>I have a lot of objections to social media - on a philosophical basis and a business one - but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s reasonable to say it&#x27;s &quot;dying&quot; or &quot;getting worse.&quot; From the perspective of the people running the companies (the only perspective said companies care about), it&#x27;s doing just fine.",Facebook

The problem with all of them seems they don&#x27;t actually work reliably.<p>I tried IFFT a number of times. I&#x27;d love for it to work, but I only use it as a &quot;it&#x27;s ok if this breaks, missing data, etc.&quot; tool. Admittedly this is not 100% their fault as you are at the mercy of the shoddiness of other APIs, but bugs upon bugs and the less than reliable nature of IFFT actually executing things in a timely, durable manner makes it 100x less useful and impossible to build on top of for real apps.<p>I also feel that from a business point of view, relying on other people&#x27;s services is consistently a trap. Whether it&#x27;s social networks like Twitter, COTS like SharePoint, or something like Evernote, it&#x27;s always a trap. These businesses can break your code at any time they choose, shut off your service, or simply go under. It takes a lot of work circumventing their bugs and terrible APIs as well.

2014-07-14 02:11:22,Hardware Case Study: Why Lockitron Has Taken So Long To Ship,"Wow, you are all over this thread. I take issue with the way you are jumping in here with a lot of assumptions. Please give me a moment to respond to your assertions point by point.<p>There is nothing glamorous about airing our faults and where we went wrong along the way, the points you enumerate were our beliefs to a &#x27;T&#x27; when we launched our second product a year and a half ago. A handful of these are right while others are mostly wrong or misguided.<p>1) This is a tough one to address. I see elsewhere in this thread you made the same mistake we did - namely thinking we could get 2mA with PS-POLL. While possible in the lab, that is simply not the case when working under conditions we&#x27;ve seen in the wild. Hypothetically if that were true you could see near instantaneous WiFi all the time. We were optimistic this may be possible but didn&#x27;t want to bet on it. We made the call that WiFi is advertised with instant response when someone is at the door and delayed response when in power save mode. If there is confusion we are quick to correct on Facebook, Twitter, and even our own blog[1]. Firmware updates to our WiFi chipset look promising but we are not committing to this.<p>2) Determining intent is a hard problem but hardly a fool&#x27;s errand. We don&#x27;t do this through just one BLE radio using RSSI alone as your comment implies[2]. The examples you give are both solvable with what we&#x27;ve built today. The harder problems come from platform inconsistency between iPhone and Android API&#x27;s. Android for instance only recently announced BLE support and when they did, the phone could only operate in one out of the two roles. Clearly other companies think similar home vs away intent is worth developing too[3][4].<p>3) Building a proper prototype without functional mechanicals is insane. Don&#x27;t do this. The other huge rabbit hole here is the word &#x27;reliably.&#x27; It&#x27;s like a client of a web design firm asking for 100% uptime.[5] The best you should do at the &#x27;hardware startup making a prototype&#x27; phase is to get it working on your target platform and solve known bugs so it works for 90 to 99.9% with loose specs or 100% of the time under tight optimal conditions. That said, things change. The way we were doing BLE security when we launched was thought to be secure. A ShmooCon talk instilled some doubts that while not broken it may not be the best foundation [6]. We rebuilt a lot of that with Diffie-Hellman and HMAC instead. We saw some connectivity issues with the new approach that were subsequently addressed. Other things change too. Our BLE chip switched from not using signed licenses to using signed licenses between updates. This caused us a bunch of frustration.<p>4) 40 hours of work to review a design is probably too little. We spent closer to 300 hours on the EE side with the most senior hacker we knew [7]. We worked with another firm on mechanics for 11 months prior to launch. In retrospect that feels about right for how much weight mechanical problems are vs electrical.<p>That $25-$30 number you site IS misleading. As an analogy, it is almost certainly possible to build a robot which can walk a straight line across a plastic table for this but getting it to walk across arbitrary terrain will cost you if your operating specs are unbounded (think Mars rover.) We know how to build a device that fits over locks for $25 without PCB - we are not happy with what level of performance that gets us.<p>5) This product however is not designed to be a replacement lock. We have made one of those in the past[8]. Saying something is wrong&#x2F;inefficient is true for anything asked to do something other than what it is made for. This model of Lockitron is designed to fit over a wide variety of existing locks precisely so that it can work for renters who can not change their locks. It is designed to do it in a way that it does not requires you to take your lock apart so it can be installed quickly and with next to zero mechanical aptitude. It does these things insanely well.<p>The numbers you site for gear vendors are again misleading. Yes, one can get gears for this cost in this time but you are shifting the burden of development and tooling elsewhere. Making this tradeoff in this case gets us towards a local maxima that is not the product&#x27;s desired function.<p>6) This is a bit naive. You don&#x27;t build to the spec if you&#x27;re seeing different results in the field. We saw this to be the case with sticky locks and jammy door frames. Other new locks can be put on a clean installation, we have to work with what&#x27;s there. Similarly, the Bluetooth 4.0 and 4.1 specs promise a lot of things which neither Apple nor Android support. In this case we build for what effects our customers experience not a certification checkbox - especially when that means exceeding the certifications standards.<p>And if anything that is the takeaway here. Building something to spec is a finite task with an estimable amount of work and calculable delivery date. Having real world conditions conflict with what was spec&#x27;ed introduces delays. Having conflicts across your product from metals and plastics up to software interfaces means these delays propagate.<p>You make the tough calls.

2014-05-20 18:14:53,Distributed Systems and the End of the API,"<i>I&#x27;ll certainly grant that the latter comes with a body of current programming practice and infrastructure, but that hardly an endorsement of its relative quality or suitability for the job-to-be-done.</i><p>You don&#x27;t see &quot;comes with a body of current programming practice and infrastructure&quot; as an endorsement for &quot;suitability for the job-to-be-done&quot;? :)  It doesn&#x27;t bear directly on the main discussion we&#x27;re having, but for people who are trying to get things done, I would say it&#x27;s quite a strong endorsement of a particular practice to say that we understand how to apply it successfully and that there are tools, known patterns, and infrastructure around it.<p>Verifying authorization on a set of operations is hard or easy depending on what the operations are.  High-level operations that correspond to the actions that users are presented with in the user interface tend to be easy to secure and validate.  Low-level database operations tend to be hard to secure and validate as your data model becomes complicated, because you basically have to reverse-engineer the high-level operation that licensed the low-level operations (which could be many and spread across different tables).<p>I think the best way to expose a Facebook wall (say) via CRDT is to define a Wall datatype whose operations are the permitted high-level actions you can take on a wall.  Then they are easy to validate, as you say.  This is sort of how Google Docs is implemented -- the core of the application consumes high-level operations (insert column, sort rows, etc.) from different users and updates the document state, and then this core is replicated in different data centers.  Most discussions I&#x27;ve seen seem to assume that CRDT and OT operations are simple, generic operations, but I think the real magic is in treating it as a paradigm like OO and defining datatypes within it.<p>I still have a hard time conceptualizing an API call as a timeless, commutative modification to a model.  I love CRDT and OT, but I&#x27;ve just seen too many network APIs to put them in a box.  Meteor actually has more shared data model between client and server than any other framework I know of.  The general case of APIs, for us, is you tell the server to go do something, and it tells you when it&#x27;s done it, and you also get streaming updates for the parts of the data model you care about (and a marker telling at what point the changes you caused landed).<p>Basically my main point is that you still need high-level verbs that carry intent, whether they are API calls or operations.  Otherwise you have data changing and no accounting for it.  It&#x27;s like how banking is mainly about transactions, not about telling each other how much money is in account X or Y.",Facebook
2014-04-30 21:45:07,Introducing Anonymous Login and an Updated Facebook Login,"What you say is not always true either.<p>I do Python mostly. Django? Fine.

Now I barely do Django development today so please excuse me behind any insane changes.<p>Flask and Pyramid world? Custom auth to me. They both have community modules for auth stuff, but do I really like them? I am not the kind of guy just pip install random &quot;useful&quot; package these days. Let&#x27;s give another example. A year or two ago I tried to do social auth in some of my django and flask apps. Maybe I was dumb but using that social-auth library took me a while to get some of login working. Plus, the code was messy and buggy. In the end, I said screw that and implemented all of the custom login myself, just reading the official doc from twitter and facebook. That also took me a while but I knew the whole implementation inside-out. If I don&#x27;t trust my own implement because it is insecure, then I must spend the same amount of time inspecting other people&#x27;s custom modules.<p>The truth is, generic auth system is hard and is not flexible. In fact, too flexible can be a bad thing: <a href=""http://plope.com/pyramid_auth_design_api_postmortem"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;plope.com&#x2F;pyramid_auth_design_api_postmortem</a><p>I like customized auth system based on the api provided by the framework - that&#x27; what makes Pyramid powerful to me.

2014-04-28 13:10:02,Ask HN: Reasons behind renaissance of functional programming languages,"A signed access token is how identity is provided in a stateless environment.<p>Take Facebook OAuth for example. A user logs in, is provided with a signed access token by FB, and then uses that token to prove to an application that the owner of the secret key has granted them permission. The owner in this case was Facebook itself.<p>This can be verified by the server by comparing the:<p>var expectedSignature = crypto.createHmac(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, FACEBOOK_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET).update(encodedData[1]).digest(&#x27;base64&#x27;).replace(&#x2F;\\+&#x2F;g,&#x27;-&#x27;).replace(&#x2F;\\&#x2F;&#x2F;g,&#x27;_&#x27;).replace(&#x27;=&#x27;,&#x27;&#x27;);<p>with the signed request signature:<p>var signature = signedRequest.split(&#x27;.&#x27;,2)[0];<p>and making sure that they&#x27;re the same.<p>This way the server never needs to maintain sessions, cookies, or a whole bunch of other crappy, centralized, coupled, insecure methods for building networked software. The server only needs the secret keys of whatever access tokens users might be providing. The access token contains the userId or any other relevant information. If the server needs more information about the user, it can provide the access token to another API that returns more information about the user, again, based solely on the access token, just by passing state INTO whatever system&#x2F;function&#x2F;service needs it.<p>If this server is sitting in front of a database all that the server cares about is what the access permissions are of whatever incoming request it is dealing with. It still doesn&#x27;t need to maintain state. The database is maintaining state, but the server is just verifying that the request can make the changes to the state of the database.<p>All with the wonders of functions, modules, and APIs that try to operate without managing their own internal state, which again, is the main feature of functional programming languages.",Facebook

However, I have two small problems and one large problem with it:<p>- It&#x27;s impossible to go back and select another payment option once you click one of them.<p>- You can&#x27;t style your payment dialog. (This may be a good thing [consistency], but I think it&#x27;d be nice to be able to add custom CSS to the pricing dialog.)<p>My large problem is that the price is crazy; your 50 cent per transaction fee means that for all transactions under $7 you collect more in fees than Stripe does. With a $5 payment - very common for services such as the one I&#x27;ll release soon - I&#x27;m paying 20% to you. With a $1 payment, I pay a prohibitive 83% in fees. That&#x27;s a really large cut compared to using the Stripe API directly, and I think that for anyone looking to increase their profits it&#x27;s a no-brainer to cut Snappy Checkout out of the equation.<p>To give a personal example, my service will be primarily receiving $5 payments. For the first 1000 payments or so, I&#x27;ll probably stick with Snappy - the $500 I give up isn&#x27;t worth the time I would&#x27;ve spent rolling my own solution. However, as soon as I can see that there&#x27;s a clear market for my product, I&#x27;ll roll my own with Stripe - I clearly wouldn&#x27;t want to give up 20% to payment processing alone.<p>Meanwhile, Frank is selling antique vases on Facebook for $1.5k each, and he pays 50 cents a transaction to you.<p>However, if you were to switch to a flat fee + a percentage (say 1.5% and 15 cents), as Stripe does, you would probably retain my business for a lot longer. Suddenly, I pay a 4.5% cut to you as opposed to a 10% cut, which is quite reasonable. At the same time, Frank the antique vase seller doesn&#x27;t really care about a 1.5% fee: a win-win situation.<p>tl;dr I recommend that you change to a percentage of the total sales: sellers of cheap items will use your service and sellers of expensive items won&#x27;t care.

The APIs we need to use to make money change, sometimes on a daily basis. We get no notification when these changes happen. We find out because our games suddenly stop working. Facebook also has a history of trying to screw game developers over in an attempt to get a bigger chunk of cash for themselves. Case in point, they tried to mandate that everybody use Facebook Credits for in game currency. Not only did facebook take 30% off the top (effectively slashing our existing revenues by 30%), but we had to use their API to process transactions. Their buggy, buggy API.

They should both be available so I can choose either. It&#x27;s complicated to aggregate content from a variety of sources into a single page, so it&#x27;s not a surprise why this option isn&#x27;t frequently available. You would almost need a new standard, so HN could provide an API for a user&#x27;s comments, posts, etc, and Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc, all do the same. Then I can build an app that merges all of this information together. So a user opens the app, and creates a page for John, enters John&#x27;s Facebook profile, Twitter&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;HN handles, and everything appears in a single place.

2014-01-01 14:42:12,React: Another Level of Indirection,"I&#x27;ve been playing with Facebook&#x27;s React to make an internal interactive resource scheduling system for our company.  So far I think I&#x27;m getting it... and am thrilled with how it works.<p>React eschews the attempt to split the View &#x2F; ModelView that are the hallmark of most full-service frameworks. Instead of this separation, React applications are built by defining reusable, nested components, each having a render() method that mixes binding and logic to build sub-parts of a web page using their custom DOM.  Each component has an internal mutable state and a set of read-only properties it gets from its parent context. In React, &quot;data binding&quot; is just part of rendering.<p>Since React owns the DOM, it&#x27;s incompatible with JQuery; or rather, if you use JQuery, you could do it in a leaf node and manage the boundary carefully.  React tracks things by using a hierarchical identifier, each key unique within each level of the structure.  It then has a predictable&#x2F;fast algorithem for detecting changes and updating the DOM.  Unless you provide your own component keys (used to build the DOM id) all the way down, you need to use CSS classes (rather than IDs).<p>Finally, I&#x27;d say, React really seems like a library -- and one that has a low API to functionality ratio.  That is, it really does something substantial with relatively few things you need to learn.  If you have your own in-house framework, it might be something you could weave in gradually rather than do a wholesale adoption of a larger (measured via API surface) framework.",Facebook

2013-11-20 14:39:05,Xbox One: The Review,"I would say that people, and their reasons for objecting to surveillance or having privacy concerns far are more complicated and varied than you are imagining.  Some of the people who have expressed concerns may be:<p>Citizens concerned about government officials overstepping constitutional bounds and lying about it, but not particularly concerned about the practical consequences of the surveillance.<p>Activists for whom NSA surveillance confirms that government  is not on the side of the people, but whose sense of history leads them to the conclusion that if massive FBI files, Jim Crow laws, and lynching did not stop the Civil Rights movement, metadata is unlikely to prevent the arc of history bending towards justice.<p>“Airbus nationalists” in Europe who are, in their heart, more concerned about the fact the EU seems to be incapable of developing a Facebook, Google, Twitter, ect. They may ape the language of their fellow citizens whose privacy concerns are based on Nazi&#x2F;Stasi&#x2F;etc. historical experience, but actually view cloud computing as industrial policy struggle.  Video game manufacture is likely not their strategic priority.<p>People with specific consequentialist privacy concerns.  For example, someone who hates Facebook because it has caused something embarrassing to be shared without their truly informed consent. They may be indifferent to the notion that embarrassing information is hidden on a government database, and they may actually welcome and value that Google algorithms leverage their g-mail and search history to serve up more relevant ads.<p>People who once cared, but are so sick of monomaniacs hijacking every HN discussion that they are looking forward to buying an Xbox One simply as a sign of contempt.  They likely also once were vaguely sympathetic to Google Reader users, but now see the product discontinuation as just punishment of tiresome and entitled whiners.<p>You may feel that all of these types of  people are wrongheaded, but change often happens because large groups of loosely affiliated people band together, and rarely because zealots double down and fail to see why anyone might <i>consider</i> a different point of view.",Facebook
2013-11-17 07:30:39,Dear Googles: G+/YouTube Anschluss – you've done outed me,"A comment I left a few weekends ago, which addressed the same topic but before the Youtube&#x2F;G+ story broke: [0]<p>&quot;Hijacking the top comment to talk about a big concern I have. This EFF article argues that there&#x27;s a place for Anonymity on the Internet [1], and I think most of us agree (especially if we emphathize with those in Iran, China, Syria, and the like).<p>But what HNers must realize is the following: The mainstream Internet <i>can not become</i> the Tor-visited Dark-Net (which restores anonymity) that many believe is inevitable WITHOUT losing its positive sociological impact. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, even HN rely on anonymity and also provide a great deal of such value.  Here&#x27;s a simple example of &#x27;sociological impact&#x27;: CNN (FoxNews, etc) pays attention to what the top links on Reddit are, because the site is in the public&#x27;s face -- and: the people have a collective voice.<p>Next: Without the perception of anonymity, sites like Reddit will stop flourishing.<p>Let&#x27;s go deeper:  Reddit&#x27;s culture thrives on &quot;anonymity&quot; in the form of throwaway accounts and people being themselves without representing themselves.  Throwaway accounts (heard of &#x27;Cation Bot&#x27; or &#x27;AWildSketchAppeared&#x27;?) are a form of expression unique to environments which allow for anonymity (pseudonyms). Who&#x27;s to say novelty accounts would be as risque or hilarious without anonymity?  Certainly these sites flourish because users feel comfortable playing a part and taking a chance.<p>There are two issues at play which threaten anonymity on Reddit. Now obvious (in light of Snowden&#x27;s leaks): 1.) Reddit usernames can, and probably are, being mapped to peoples&#x27; actual identity. ... Not as obvious: 2.) Users&#x27; up and down votes, even private messages, can also be sniffed with ease.<p>Reddit&#x27;s&#x27; devteam has retreated from the idea of providing HTTPS for its voting&#x2F;web API [2], so people&#x27;s actions (aside from comments) can be mapped as well. I tried to raise awareness of this issue five months ago [3].  I know there&#x27;s an argument to be made that SSL&#x2F;HTTPS is useless anyway (just use Tor!, they say), but the bigger question remains:<p>Can a mainstream community such as Reddit exist in tomorrow&#x27;s Internet?  I&#x27;d say that such web-societies are fragile -- likely targets of dragnet surveillance and subversion, especially given their disruptive nature.<p>People and the press are paranoid about Facebook&#x2F;Google privacy because its users (are encouraged to) identify themselves <i>explicitly</i>, but the reality is no different with sites like Reddit - just the perception. Just think about how much more is shared on a site like Reddit by its members because of their pseudonyms! Few people aside from the avid Tor-using&#x2F;&#x2F;r&#x2F;netsec crowd have realized this.<p>Reddit is the internet &quot;as we know it,&quot; and I feel the Internet is about to change.<p>In hindsight - Google&#x27;s initial &quot;no pseudonyms&quot; policy for Google+ was prescient -- though the company eventually capitulated to popular demand for them.

2013-11-04 05:17:38,Django plugins you shouldn't start without,"&gt; There&#x27;s also poor testability, inability to re-use functions that reference the request internally, inability to statically analyze dependencies (less of an issue in Python, since the lack of types makes it hard to analyze them anyway), additional context that the developer must keep in his head, and inability to cross-reference parameters &amp; call-sites and identify where a given variable is coming from in code browsers or debuggers.<p>I don&#x27;t know. Most of them seem like a non issue to me. Shouldn&#x27;t the api cover that testability(of request)? At least, it does in Flask. Re-using a function which uses request won&#x27;t be any different from re-using a function which uses datetime. I do get your point about difficulty of analyzing Python owing to dynamic typing and monkey patching, but I couldn&#x27;t connect it to context local. As for cross referencing, you just treat request as you treat datetime.<p>&gt; Singletons are no better - if you dress it up as RequestManager.get_current_request(), it&#x27;s just as bad. If you don&#x27;t understand why something is a bad idea, complying with the letter of the law without complying with the spirit doesn&#x27;t really get you much.<p>I won&#x27;t do that. That is just a tongue in cheek comment to appease &quot;death to globals&quot; police.<p>&gt; Now I want my programs to do as little as possible and have access to as little as possible.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with that but assuming that the request object is available for the request lifecycle is pretty reasonable.<p>&gt; Usually I end up pulling out the values I want inside the view function and calling any helpers using only those values, so I don&#x27;t pass the request around anyway.<p>You don&#x27;t pass around request in a general workflow(why would you?). But consider this <a href=""https://github.com/tschellenbach/Django-facebook"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tschellenbach&#x2F;Django-facebook</a>. This does a post save signal when a new user registers. I need to send a welcome mail to the user asking him to activate his account. I need request.build_absolute_uri to construct the uri, and guess what, I don&#x27;t have request in the callback and I don&#x27;t have a way to obtain it. Now there can be other ways I can solve it - configure sites and generate url using sites; simply have the base url in settings and construct the url by doing a urljoin; may be in some alternate universe, django&#x27;s reverse generates external url. But the thing is, I have needed access to request object on more than a few occasions. Granted if the callback passed me the request object, it won&#x27;t have been an issue but it doesn&#x27;t and I had to resort to thread local middleware to save the request object.<p>&gt; A fourth was that I worked a bunch with both systems and found that adding a parameter to each function along a call path is easy<p>The issue is apis which you haven&#x27;t wrote. I can always change the packages myself, but I don&#x27;t want to sync up with upstream for something I see as a small change.",Facebook

2013-10-17 11:14:03,Did these guys just reinvent the Web?,"Since when did &#x27;the web&#x27; involve giving away all the source code and not charging people for things? Did Google open source their search engine and let anybody advertise on their site for free while I wasn&#x27;t looking?<p>I really don&#x27;t understand this meme about the web being &#x27;open&#x27;. Much of the native desktop software I use is open source. Practically none of the web services I use are open source. There is not much chance of a &#x27;GNU project&#x27; for the web (i.e. reimplementing an open google and twitter and facebook and so on). Open source web services of significance are few and far between and when it comes to controlling our data usually the best we get is a proprietary API that may or may not get shut down or changed tomorrow.<p>The web gave us RSS which was good[1] but since then it has been pretty much a non stop stream of proprietary APIs and platform lock-in. Even things built on RSS tend to be proprietary APIs rather than open standards: take Google Reader for example. Before it shut down it should have been trivial to pull your subscriptions out of it and point your clients at a new replacement rss-syncing server (like you can do with an email client). But it wasn&#x27;t because there was no damn standard for that, just proprietary APIs as various people wanted to lock you into their cloud service. The standards that have emerged have been, of course, ones that generally involve lock-in to proprietary platforms, like OAuth.<p>[1] interestingly many of the new generation of web developers seem to dislike RSS.",Facebook

There should be some central hub for research and exchange ;)<p>Disconnected knowledge-islands with people not knowing about already existing solutions to problems they are trying to solve seems to be one downside of scattered communities.<p>Decentralization is needed for private communication, but there are downsides - creating x parallel nets will not help in finding each others - the knowledge evolution of the internet is driven by the desire of the human brain to connect all available information.<p>Imagine the NSA decided to create an open and freely available API to the centralized information they have collected - good-minded people certainly will extract useful knowledge from that data, possibly world-changing new ways of thinking about everything could be the results.<p>The human brain wants this central intelligence (the real one, not the agency) to solve the evolutionary problems we are confronted with today - it must be seen as an ironical evidence of this need that the first biggest data collections that might be useful for all humans on this planet are collected exclusively by paranoid psychopaths to have better tools for control and oppression.<p>But even if misused, it does happen - the human brain wants to connect. It will not be happy with decentralized knowledge - it is the reason, why the internet exists and it will not want to go back.<p>This does not mean that decentralized networks are a bad thing in itself (as I said before, needed for private talk urgently!), but it means that we need some information harvesting entity that makes it easy to connect.<p>It is not only marketing what makes google and facebook so successful - it is the biological meta-programming of our brains that make us want to use these possibilities to connect to the global information pool.<p>The global brain is the destination - of course it should be untouchable by insane sadist that want to control our life. This evolutionary force will lead to social changes - it does already.<p>Re-Decentralizing the internet, from this point of view, only postpones the real challenge: build technical and social systems, that can not be misused or at least make it easier to detect and eliminate misuse - we have already concepts for this, we need to apply. Real-life IDS will warn you if you consume fake information or are following the wrong leaders (or if you are following at all). Real-life social SIEM will prevent a group of people misusing the system just for their own profits. 
Most probably &quot;profit&quot; will be an ancient word that will be remembered only with shame, like being confronted with the primitive life of our ancestors, that were living in caves.<p>Decentralization will not rescue us from our duty to expand participation.",Facebook
2013-10-11 23:45:42,Fight bike theft with the open source bike registry,"Just how many of these shops are there that have been registering your bikes and how many bikes have they registered for you?<p>Do you have any idea about POS systems?<p>Because of how the industry for POS has developed (fragmented) you cannot guarantee that a POS system is online - it talks to a server in the back office and that code was written aeons before the acronym API came into parlance.<p>Shops stick with legacy POS systems because they have a database of customers and stock on there. To migrate to the all singing and all dancing POS system that will work with your system is not at all as straightforward or as likely to happen as you imagine. Staff training, hardware (to open the drawer and get the scanner working), cost of new software - it is just not going to happen, no matter how clumsy and visual-basic-y it is. There are even small bike shops that don&#x27;t have POS!!!<p>You are in cloud cuckoo land if you think for one moment that you are ever going to get POS systems in bike shops to talk to your web service. Sure one or two hipster-shops in Chicago run by your mate who wrote his own POS system in Ruby on Rails with loads of angular.js one weekend, but I think you haven&#x27;t any option but to completely forget about it for the majority of bike shops - even large chains with decent IT departments - it is so not realistic what you are talking about.<p>I haven&#x27;t bought a Specialized for a while, however, historically, their manuals have been out of date. This goes for every other brand going and this has been the case for the last 25 years - yes I was mechanic 25 years ago so I know these things. Nobody watches DVD&#x27;s by the way, do they?<p>People do read the manuals, not always and not cover to cover. With a bicycle what else do you do when you get home with a new one and it is gone dark - read the manual! Maybe not in Chicago, but, enthusiastic owners with a new pride and joy certainly do give the manual some attention. If it was spruced up with some online registration thingamy in there then think how much easier it could be. So I think you are being deliberately irksome by flippantly saying that nobody reads the manual - that is not a certainty. If the manual included a cheque for a million dollars in the back then I am sure that even people that cannot read would read the manual. If, like the UK brands I know, the manual is not exactly scintillating then it gets picked over and cast aside.<p>With the manual approach you get two bites at the cherry - in the shop by your mates in Chicago and, for everywhere else, something people can be prompted to do from the comfort of their own home.<p>You are being cynical thinking customers don&#x27;t want to be marketed to. In an age when people put so much cr4p about themselves on Facebook etc. The guarantee&#x2F;warranty form as means of building up a customer database has worked for at least a century. It is a trick but then it isn&#x27;t perceived as a trick by people outside your bit of Chicago. If there is something in it for the customer - an actual warranty - they don&#x27;t hesitate to sign up. It is that simple. Just make it online.<p>For any scheme such as yours to work it really does need to work for all stakeholders and involve all stakeholders. That means the customer, law enforcement, the retailers, the distributors, the manufacturers and the trade organisations (at retail and manufacturer level). What credibility does your scheme have if it is &#x27;just a kickstarter project&#x27; rather than something that the important stakeholders have committed to?<p>I have read other comments on this thread and the dupe and I don&#x27;t hear anyone saying this is just what the world needs. Sure my comments are unvarnished but I am trying to share with you my better ideas gained from practical experience dealing with the problem in hand.<p>The Bike Index name is not doing it for me.

The top navigation is clear and it Google paid-search-results to the top of stolen bikes. The police have their logo on it. There is a lot I would want to change about the site but it is getting there without any off-putting web design. It has a team keen on what they do with IT support, some sales potential for security products and it looks like they are going to stay around for a while. It works to the extent that it does without a lot of support from shops but with a lot of support from the Police. They have stakeholders. In the UK you would have to be a fool to go up against them or provide a new angle with some other service that is the same but more open-source-designed-on-a-mac-with-web-2.0-stuff. It has to be one place people go, not one of many (for a given country).
The people behind bikeregister.com sell marker products. These are the slowest sellers ever in a bike shop, even worse selling than those face masks or arcane BMX trinkets (BMXers have to get mum to pay, don&#x27;t they...). So they haven&#x27;t got the right &#x27;in&#x27; at the retail level. However, I have seen their leaflets around - in shops - so they have tried what you have been trying. Maybe you should talk to them rather than go off thinking you knows bestest...<p>People wanting to show off their bikes already have forums for that, forums that have online community whom you would want to share things with. I know a small amount of people that do such things because they have an angle - retro, weight or niche brand being the &#x27;why&#x27;. Those into the sport have a passing interest in the kit, it is results that matter to them, hence showing off their latest steed is not their gig, if it is then &#x27;weight weenies&#x27; forum it is. Sure &#x27;weight weenies&#x27; (popular over here) may be some dated bulletin board thing but it works and you aren&#x27;t USP enough to that crowd for them to shift over to &#x27;bike index&#x27;. So this showing off one&#x27;s bike thing is doomed, it dilutes the main purpose.<p>Sorry to be harshly negative, but you did post on here to get advice and sometimes people aren&#x27;t honest when they say &#x27;yeah babes fab!&#x27;. I hope for your sake that you don&#x27;t take $50K of people&#x27;s hard earned cash for this - you need a better plan and to come back later when you have got it. Don&#x27;t stop the coding, the testing, the user experience testing and what you are doing in the bike shop already. Go bigger, just pick up the phone and talk to some other people who can help you - the UK bikeregister people could help you with ideas. Get involved at the industry level - go to a big trade show and speak to the top bods, bash their heads together and get an industry solution. Please give up on any dreams of POS systems magically doing it all, or at least visit a dozen bike shops and see what rubbish POS systems they actually use.",Facebook
2013-09-30 09:55:23,"Ask HN: How many ""self-taught"" programmers and how did you do it?","1) Inspiration followed by Realisation followed by Ambition.  I started messing around in Microsoft Frontpage age 11 (2000ish). I was shown how to make a simple VB6 program by my father (2002). Here I came to understand logic and how GUI&#x27;s make stuff happen on computers. I wrote trolling&#x2F;phishing tools for AOL for about a year making use of more complicated hooks written by other people (2003). I then turned back to the web with PHP, since it was a more accessible way to get my things into the hands of people (2004). I played computer games back when you could mod them - I wrote scripts, made 3d models and textures. This is where ambition set in. My first PHP real project when I thought I&#x27;d learnt what I was doing was a messaging app with login &#x2F; registration (2005). I found MySQL doing this. I had a MySQL book which I referred to but it was the only book I really used to learn. My peers found security holes in my app, the login had a redirect which included the user id in a get argument, which you could simply change (true story). This taught me the importance of considering how people will attack my code. <i>This was a critical factor in helping me learn to code</i> When you consider from another perspective, you more deeply understand what it is you&#x27;re doing. I continued with PHP and MySQL and the front end stack, I kept pushing myself, starting ambitious projects (hell, I can build Facebook) that ultimately I&#x27;d never finished. I got bored quickly, I was always doing something new. Back to PHP, Zend Framework (my first framework) provided another giant leap in my understanding (2006). I delved into it, I realised how much I can learn from others. I learnt the benefit of going into the code and understanding it. I learnt design patterns, I learnt what good software looked like, I began to write software, rather than &#x27;web pages&#x27;. I dropped out of college and got my first job as a web developer writing PHP websites and doing sys admin for hundreds of clients, alone (2007, age 18). I started to get good at what I did professionally. I began looking harder at other languages, but only a little. I wouldn&#x27;t start projects with new languages, just appreciate them from afar. Ruby, Python, Go, C#, Java. I realised that databases, other software, tools, services and api&#x27;s are all just components or tools, nothing to fear and held new and potentially better ideas than I had at the moment. MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, zeromq, RabbitMQ, memcache. I carried on focussing on few languages but becoming far more capable and adaptable for the next 4&#x2F;5 years. In 2011 I started to become interested in JavaScript and doing that properly, because it&#x27;d always been taken for granted with jQuery being such a great API. 
2013 I&#x27;m writing browser-based apps and apis. You can ask me to do anything and I&#x27;ll probably be pretty good.<p>Slacker at school, College drop out, in full time employment since the age of 18. Now a multi-skilled contractor at 25.

2013-09-23 13:21:56,Why The New Gmail Sucks,"The Google redesign seems to be about creating a walled garden, tied together by Google Plus, Android, and aggressive highlighting of other Google services on each page.<p>Maybe they fear that if they don&#x27;t trap the users, Facebook will. Either way, the continued high user figures at Yahoo show that it&#x27;s possible. To do it, they need to stop being a search engine (to discover others content, leave the garden), and become a portal, the only web experience you&#x27;ll ever need.<p>I think this becomes necessary because on a tablet, people use apps, and if those aps are deep enough, they may never escape them. You could make a tablet that just ran the facebook ap, an a subset of users would be happy. They need a counter trap.<p>To me, to them, any other GUI changes that crept in are likely incidental. Does it tie in with Google Plus? Will it work on a tablet?, Does it look like our tablet ap?, would be the primary question.",Facebook
2013-09-17 17:21:20,iOS App Store now allows legacy downloads to support older OSes,"I think this will help out consumers overall, but I don&#x27;t want customers posting negative reviews of my app because the old version they downloaded crashes due to a Facebook or Twitter API change that I patched the app for months ago. Considering that folks post reviews from to-be-released versions of the OS, I assume Apple will let these folks post reviews as well?",Facebook
2013-09-14 15:08:48,On Contact Management,"Yes, I agree with you that the way we manage our contact date is outdated.<p>The problems nowadays are:<p>1) If you include pseudonyms and literally all user data, you will earn the distrust of millions of users that don&#x27;t want this data centralized in the databases of one company. 
(I know it is possible to figure out almost all the interconnections e.g. via IP, Cookies, Location data, your browsing history. But still they are given implicit. Handing all your user data to one company firsthand plays in a totally different league.)<p>2) This system, especially the automatic updates via sent out API calls, requires deep integration in countless pieces of software. Windows, Mac, Linux and all their ways of managing contacts, the corresponding mobile systems need to adapt and what about the business sector?
You could counter that it is a standalone app and the user has the choice on every platform. And that would be the next problem. All the existing services (about.me, dooid.me, even the Gravatar, or even providing a downloadable or scannable .vcard file or QR-code on a self-hosted webpage) are not used by any majority of people. Why?  The majority simply does not submerge that deeply into the technology. 
Yet another service that bring yet more responsibilities (setting up privacy boundaries etc.) might be appealing to the techy-nerdy kind, but not at all to &quot;Joe Average&quot;.<p>3) What this would need is huge company&#x27;s backup. And to be honest, Google has had the chance...but they screwed it up. Google+. The idea behind the circles is great (hence the resemblance to your &quot;spheres&quot;?). But tying it to yet another social network and forcing it upon it&#x27;s users is not the way to build a user base that trusts and accepts the platform.
I don&#x27;t believe any piece of statistic released talking of 400 Million registered users (of course, because they force it upon the Google Play and YouTube users) or the 100 Million active users (of course, YouTube commenters, still want to comment). If I check my Google+ Stream it is dead to 95% of my contacts. There is less going on than on facebook. (Which we all apparently distrust and has seriously lost the contact management game.)<p>All this leads me to the conclusion that the introduction of an important functionality like the one you describes can&#x27;t be done by any kind of service.<p>It should become a &quot;protocol&quot;. Maybe a vcard-protocol. And in the best case a P2P based one that is encrypted. Why?
- My user data doesn&#x27;t change every second, so there is absolutely no need for 99,99% availability.
- Our smartphones are online almost 24&#x2F;7 anyways. And in addition our various other internet access devices even increase that number ;)
- Ot the information could be circled around in the P2P-network, highly encrypted. As the data size of maybe a profile picture and a bunch of contact details is not really an issue, this actually would be feasible.
- It could be combined with PGP, maybe even use the very same keys. Which could and should increase the number of users encrypting their conversations.
- The information would not leave the users hands unencrypted. 
- The possibilities are defined by the protocol and the user has to set up allowances (sphere permissions) accordingly on the platform he uses.
- As you now can setup various IMAP mail accounts you could create various vcard-information snippets for all the various identities you want to manage.
- A unique ID of course is necessary, this could be used for the NFC&#x2F;BT or just motion-sensor&#x2F;timestamp&#x2F;location based (&quot;bumping&quot;) handshake to exchange the information. The encrypted vcard-information package can of course be published directly or in form of a link&#x2F;QR-code via NFC&#x2F;BT&#x2F;local Wifi.
- It should not be file based to the user.
- The encryption (I don&#x27;t know if PGP allows this) should be able to terminate itself if the user didn&#x27;t refresh the permission or didn&#x27;t prolong the availability.<p>The big problem is...how can a protocol like this be made attractive to be used.
One would need a group of manufacturers&#x2F;companies, like Google with Android and it&#x27;s web-based contact database and Apple with iOS and it&#x27;s horrible contacts App.<p>The problem is...there is too much money in user-data... 
So I guess all of the above will remain a dream. *sigh",Facebook

Amazon won&#x27;t go down.&quot;)<p>* Your CTO is the only person on the company who knows the product, and he quits overnight &#x2F; gets injured &#x2F; becomes incapacitated. (&quot;He&#x27;s my partner.  He&#x27;d never abandon the business.  We&#x27;re in this together.&quot;)<p>* You rely solely on Facebook &#x2F; Twitter &#x2F; Apple App Store and are at the mercy of their changes in policy (&quot;Oh Facebook would never just shut us down.&quot;)<p>* You&#x27;re built solely on the Foursquare Places API. (&quot;Foursquare won&#x27;t just kill all the companies that rely on their API...right?&quot;)<p>Etc. etc. etc.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t saying that you should be paralyzed by the potential for SPoFs to hurt your business -- it may make sense to proceed even with them around (i.e. lots of people have made a lot of money building FB apps).<p>But you MUST be aware of what they are, and you MUST have a plan in place to handle the continuation of the business if one of them comes true.",Facebook

Hence, your mobile operator definitely has this data, and is most likely already tracking it and&#x2F;or piping it to the NSA etc.<p>Significant change monitoring is used by Google Now among other apps (I believe Facebook also does this, I find that more sneaky since they have no obvious need for it). Google Maps <i>navigation</i> does not use this, since it needs more granular and accurate data hence it uses the more battery-intensive location APIs.<p>If the complaint is that it&#x27;s okay for Apple to collect this data for apps to use, but there is no need to log it, especially since the user might choose to not allow any apps to access their location data, then that&#x27;s a fair point.

I used to wonder why so many services and add-ons were built on Google properties vs Yahoo and MS, but I wonder no more; Yahoo&#x2F;MS just don&#x27;t want to compete in that space (making stuff at least usable for developers).  Facebook also seems to fall in to that camp, but right now they don&#x27;t have any major competition (except from G+ it seems).

2013-07-24 09:03:57,The sad story of Facebook Platform,"My experience with building an alternative Android Facebook client (which naturally uses almost every part of the API):<p>1) Just keeping up with documented and undocumented breaking changes is probably a full time job.<p>2) Expect that some feature of the API breaks every 2 weeks, especially login on their Android SDKs cannot be relied upon.(reliable for me is the industry standard for server uptime usually advertised - 99.99999%) If your application just uses few parts of the API it probably once every 1 or 2 months.<p>3) Substract 0.5 to 1.0 points from the rating of your app in the Android or iOS app store, depending on how heavy you rely on Facebook, because of the instability of their APIs.<p>4) Expect to spend at least a day per month writing bug reports. (Or just give up like I did)<p>5) You will do lots of reverse engineering to work around the bugs which they are constantly creating at a mind blowing rate.<p>My final conclusion after almost 2 years of working with their APIs (as a good actor) for my app (link: <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flipster&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.flipster&amp;h...</a>) is that I will never ever ever build again something that relies that much on Facebook.<p>If I need a friends list in a future project, I&#x27;ll just use the users telephone book, like I already did on a VoIP&#x2F;Messaging app for mobile that I built for the company I work for.<p>If I need private messaging I&#x27;ll just set up my own XMPP server.<p>If I need login, I will sure as hell save myself the headache of using their fucked up (and even when it is working - bad converting) login, and build one myself!",Facebook
2013-07-24 04:05:01,The sad story of Facebook Platform,"A very well-written and judicious obituary of Facebook Platform. I started building for it shortly after it launched, in late 2007. I had high hopes for it; I felt I was at the forefront of &#x27;the next big thing,&#x27; like others, so I invested a lot of my time into it. I made apps that served millions of people, one of which reached #1 in DAU at one point among all apps (back when they ranked apps by DAU).<p>As a lone developer keeping up with the changes and additions wasn&#x27;t easy - I literally ran the gamut - from FBML to FBJS to FQL to xd_receiver.htm to the JS SDK to FB Credits to Graph API. Initially I cut them some slack - it was a new platform, and we all make mistakes.<p>But things never really got better. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how many times I came across 4, 5, 6 different ways to do the same (seemingly simple) interaction with the platform, only one of which worked, and of course not the officially documented method. Or inaccurate or nonexistent API docs. Or how many times my app would suddenly break without pushing any changes - I became accustomed to just waiting it out until Facebook would release a patch for whatever they broke, and have to tell my users to just wait it out. This would usually occur Tuesday night&#x2F;Wednesday if I remember correctly.<p>Solutions to problems would usually lie in an obscure forum post after about 10 minutes of googling, posted by another friendly developer who probably tore his hair out looking for a solution. Ah, the camaraderie. Here&#x27;s a recent one I just came across (and they&#x27;re not hard to find) <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16649634/ios-url-scheme-fb-event-llu-no-longer-working-in-6-1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16649634&#x2F;ios-url-scheme-f...</a>\nAccepted answers that start with &quot;Facebook seems to have...&quot; and end with &quot;change or remove them completely at will&quot; tend to give developers more than a few gray hairs.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that Facebook tends to treat developers like sheep. At first this didn&#x27;t bother me - after all, they weren&#x27;t forcing me to build apps for them, and I was free to leave at any time. In the early days I&#x27;d contact developer support (I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a published number) to report bugs&#x2F;issues, suggest improvements, or genuinely ask for help with a problem. I never got a single non-automated response. Not once. So I stopped wasting my time and just became more and more bitter with every breaking change.<p>The 30% credits tax was the inflection point of the downfall. IMHO, that was a &quot;me too&quot; response to Apple&#x27;s iOS platform (coincidence that they came up with the same fee structure?) and was, for me, the tell-tale sign that they were no longer interested in their developers&#x27; well being. Yes, I understand they need to make money. I am all for ringing the cash register. But Apple and Facebook are different platforms. Apple has a highly trafficked worldwide app store. They let me put my app icon on my users&#x27; home screens (that&#x27;s valuable real estate), and I could push out unlimited notifications to my users&#x27; devices to keep them engaged and coming back with one click, among other things. Facebook has no such equivalents. I guess you could argue you&#x27;re paying for the viral distribution, but after they&#x27;ve heavily curtailed their viral channels and people have become more and more immune to app invites, there&#x27;s really no way to get free distribution anymore from Facebook. You still need to be buying ads, mostly from them.<p>If they wanted to make money and curtail spam, all they had to do was charge developers by each notification, invite, or newsfeed post they&#x27;d send out. Set a fixed price per message, or use a competitive auctioning system like adwords. The crapplications would never be able to afford their own spam.<p>I&#x27;ve since migrated my apps away from Facebook, either to mobile or on standalone web sites. Needless to say, my life as a developer has gotten a lot easier, and since I have more time to focus on improving my apps rather than keeping up with breaking changes, I&#x27;m doing better than I ever have before.",Facebook
2013-07-23 23:21:11,The sad story of Facebook Platform,"Admittedly I did not make it through the whole article, but the comparison to iOS early on is laughable.  The difference is A) access to a social graph of your friends and their trivial online activities vs B) a powerful touch screen computer in your pocket.<p>The Facebook API did not have some incredible mishandled potential.  Instead, it was a very cool and forward-thinking API that had to constantly be modified to fight spam and keep up with Facebook&#x27;s rapidly evolving product (which is a couple orders of magnitude more engaging now than it was in 2007 I might add).<p>Sure the Facebook API could have been better managed.  Documentation and stability could have been better for sure.   Maybe even the features could have been better.  But the Facebook API is not a world changer.  The Twitter API is more along the lines of a world changer, but they decided they needed to build the most profitable business possible and being plumbing was not in the cards.  The Facebook API is a way to bolster the core Facebook product (which is amazing, probably the most engaging product ever created in human history short of addictive substances).  This idea that if they just did right by developers it could have been so much more amazing is just a cyberpunk fantasy.  The Facebook API could never be more than a reflection of a product.<p>Looking back on the mashup era, the future is not going to be from the goodwill of corporations to provide amazing APIs.

I work for a Facebook preferred developer so we have an extra channel for getting bug feedback. If we weren&#x27;t a preferred developer, we would have had API bugs go unaddressed for months.

2013-06-20 13:39:49,PHP 5.5,"The PHP team does take speed seriously and just about every minor release gets a little bit faster, sometimes alot, like 20% faster. I&#x27;m not even including stuff like the opcode caches that are built in now like APC or Zend Optimizer+. Lots of times, minor releases also get more efficient with memory usage too. If you are not happy with the speed, PHP is an open source project and you can contribute patches to speed it up.<p>Documentation gets fixed all the time. PHP has been historically known as having one of the best docs and the docs have contributed to its success. As with the source code, the docs are open to contributions if you feel the need to modify or add something.<p>That&#x27;s funny you say PHP can&#x27;t scale. Facebook, Yahoo, Etsy and a whole lot of other big PHP shops get more traffic than most of us will ever see in a few life times. So, PHP scales. Even pre-Hiphop Facebook got more traffic than most of us will will ever see. Many times scaling is more about architecture design&#x2F;implementation than language. App Engine is all about scaling and PHP runs on it. Oh by the way, at scale, every language is a data center toaster oven.<p>PHP people aren&#x27;t mad that people are leaving. They are happy that it is still the #1 language used for web development.<p>The only valid argument you have is the mixed methods and stuff. It would be cool to fix, but it would mean seriously breaking the API and would cause a lot of confusion. Every minor release breaks the API a little bit and people are unhappy. So, this might never change. I don&#x27;t see it as a big deal because if you are a great programmer, you know the quirks of your language and they don&#x27;t throw you off. Also, there is auto-completion and docs for you to look up things if you don&#x27;t know stuff off the top of your head.<p>It is true that lots of developers have left PHP, but it is a falsehood that everybody is moving away from PHP. If that was the case, PHP wouldn&#x27;t be running on 75% of the public facing web hosts out there. There would be a business incentive (because they are using another language) to get PHP off their box. They could devote those resources to the new language they are using. The 75% number shows that their is no mass exodus, but definitely evidence not everybody is using PHP.<p>Oh, by the way, PHP is open source so you can help contribute to its continued success if you like. If somehow you have already contributed, don&#x27;t stop till the work is done.",Facebook

So search will join the social on Google Plus.<p>We know Search has a devoted following who will be very sad to see it go. Were sad too. There are two simple reasons for this: usage of Google Plus^W^WSearch has declined, and as a company were pouring all of our energy into fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better  and more sociable  user experience.<p>Its been a long time since weve had this rate of change  it probably hasnt happened since the birth of social media in July 2011, with our superior social media platform, Google Plus. So today were officially folding a number of other products into Google Plus:<p>* YouTube will become Google Plus Video. Your YouTube will be just the same, youll just need a username you have government ID for. Dont worry  you can trust us with it.<p>* Google Maps API will become Google Plus Maps. Youll need to add your house, your workplace, your favourite retail experiences and your credit card number to your circles, then you can look up any place you want. You can opt out to Apple Maps any time you like.<p>* Google Docs got absorbed by Google Drive, which will become Google SUM(). Imagine the social of your spreadsheets being rated by all your friends! Once again, users who opt out are free to revel in the joys of Office 365.<p>* Google Voice App for BlackBerry will be discontinued once weve found both remaining BlackBerry users and notified them.<p>* Orkut, of course, is being kept.<p>We know youll be delighted with the Google Plus experience, with hundreds of millions of people every month delighted to be using Google Plus! Or products that require a profile on it. Its like Facebook without all the annoying people on it. Or any people. But the people on it love it with huge enthusiasm, just like the ones who loved Google Buzz before we shot that through the head too. Come onto Plus, or Vic will cry. You dont want to see Vic crying, do you? Asshole. You probably hurt puppies, too.<p>To ensure a smooth transition, were providing a three-month sunset period so you have sufficient time to find an alternate web-searching solution. Good luck on that one. Because, and you know it in your heart, Google Plus as a search engine still sucks less than Bing.<p><a href=""http://newstechnica.com/2013/03/14/spring-clean-google-search-now-part-of-google-plus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newstechnica.com/2013/03/14/spring-clean-google-searc...</a>",Facebook

2013-05-11 01:30:56,Learn You a Haskell for Great Good,"You don't need it. If you are a Junior developer (or aiming at being one) Haskell is a language you most definitely don't need.<p>Now, once you have your feet wet, it's worth learning. Here's why:<p>- Pure(mostly) functional language. This is in opposition to  Java &#38; Ruby, which while having functional aspects are OO (Object Oriented).
- It's okay not to know what a functional language is. It's making functions first-class citizens, such that a function becomes a value like any other.
- Separates IO from computation. IO is inherently impure and unreliable, so functions are generally pure and instead wrap IO in containers. Obviously, programs would be less useful (still use in the compiler running!) without IO.
- All of these concepts (and more) will change how you think about programming and make you a better programmer in all languages.<p>Haskell can be found in some backend stacks, the more notable examples I can think of are Mailrank (acquihired by Facebook) and Bump.<p>Personally, I've only done a limited number of projects with Haskell (a Postgres-backed beer API &#38; IRC bot) but I've grown to respect it as a language and through limited exposure has made me love FP.",Facebook

2013-03-22 10:06:14,Users don't like social login,"""Sorry"", but you just moved the centralized identity to a different location, you aren't magically removing it: in fact, you <i>can't</i> magically remove it, because there is no such thing as a universal canonical form of identity. If there was, we would just use that instead of all of these more complex forms of identity we build up.<p>In the case of the e-mail address, you are moving it to the person providing the domain name the e-mail address is on; this is thereby explicitly why I brought up OpenID--which you seem to have totally ignored--as it is also a distributed system but yet it doesn't <i>force</i> the incorrect assumption that Persona does (specifically, that e-mail addresses are canonical identification mechanisms for users, and so nigh-unto encourages opaque tokens to be returned).<p>Let's put this another way: you seem to believe that there is a way to assign a token to a user in a way that works for them no matter where they are. I believe that that entire concept is a fantasy. In particular, I believe the one that Persona chose, which you seem to want to defend, only works for a very weird subset of users that are technical enough to understand that others make this incorrect assumption, and then organize their lives around it.<p>In comparison, once you assume that there is no such identifier, you start asking how you federate the choice, and you end up with the idea of ""identity providers"". However, you now have no stable way of holding on to identity as you change providers. I maintain that is an unsolvable problem, and it should be treated as an unsolvable problem: the concept of an identifier that can cross multiple identity providers is, again, a fantasy.<p>So the result is that you now have to ask the question of what identifier is used within an identity provider. I maintain that e-mail addresses are a horrible horrible choice, as they are known to be something that the people who provide them are known to reuse, and they are things many users want to be able to change often. Instead, it should be encouraged to make the token entirely opaque, with a requirement in the spec that ""this token will never get reused by any other user using your identification provider ever in the future"". AFAIK, OpenID states exactly this.<p>And yet, when I go to log in to a website using OpenID, I can select Google as my authentication provider, and then log in with my e-mail address. Later, when my e-mail address changes, I'll be able to log in with a different e-mail address, and Google will assign me the same OpenID identifier for my federated login with other websites. You end up in a similar boat if you use the various OAuth flows that other companies use, such as with Facebook, then using an API to get the stable identifier (which for Facebook is a number).<p>Look: I maintain a website with tens of millions of worldwide users, and I <i>only</i> have federated login. I deal with the issues of federated login day in and day out. I deal with users from very diverse user communities, and I see how they treat their e-mail addresses (as sadly, Google will not let you change your Gmail address without getting a new account, so a lot of users are forced into situations where their identification changes when there was no real reason why it should have been required).

2013-03-21 19:28:07,Im done with the web,"(Apologies for the big rant, these are some ideas that have been rattling about in my head recently and your post made some things clearer in my mind. It's not meant to be a post of factual 'truths', but an explanation for my (and perhaps others) reaction against the web as the one platform to rule them all. So it's as much an emotional gut reaction as a logical one. )<p>I think this (desire for ubiquity/multi-platform) is the main reason I don't see eye-to-eye with the people who are pushing for web apps for everything. Web apps everywhere is great for large corporations that want to provide their service on as many platforms as possible. It's great for venture capital funded startups where the name of the game is to get as many users as possible and get bought out before your money runs out.<p>I'm a small indie dev though, I produce software (not software as a front end to a non-software business), and I'm not looking to become a billionaire (really!). I want to develop software because I enjoy it: to solve problems for real people, to solve my own problems. So really I don't care too much about being able to target every platform at once. I want to target the platforms I like, using the tools that I like, and as long as the platform has enough users to make it viable then I can do that with native software on open platforms (the latter is important and why I don't write iOS software, for example). There is the risk that the platform I target gets killed, but if a lot of people use it then that's generally going to be a slow process, and there is plenty of churn in web tech and standards anyway so it's not like it provides immunity to technological change. Additionally, I just have a hard time working with web technologies. I find them much harder to use, to the extent that if using html/css was the only way to write software I wouldn't be writing software at all and I'd go stack shelves in the supermarket instead. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to use them effectively, I don't know.<p>I guess this is partly the old 'software as craft'/'lifestyle business' argument, but it saddens me slightly that the big industry players are moving us away from the kind of industry where you can write software that interacts with some arbitrary bit of hardware in unsupported or unintended ways towards a much more controlled and profit orientated one (i.e. your software running everywhere being the most important criterion of all). Web people are not the only offenders here of course, but arguments against things like iOS have been well explored over the years.<p>Some people seem to view the web as some kind of beacon of freedom, the little guy fighting the big bad industry giants of Microsoft, Apple, Adobe and so on. But from where I am, the web <i>is</i> the big bad industry giants. Writing web software means being restricted to a very limited sandbox. The APIs available to me are decided by what a small cabal of powerful companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Nokia and maybe a few others) can agree on. None of their interests align with mine (why would they?).<p>If Gopher had taken off and supplanted native development to the extent that people were using platforms that could only run Gopher apps, would the current web even exist? All user facing software being written to a single standard and API has good things about it, but it also limits new ideas tremendously (""sure you can add X feature you just need to get it through this committee of industry heavyweights first and get them all to agree, and then wait for them to ship it"").<p>What is important to me is that data uses open standards, whether at rest or in motion. If people control their data, and it is in open formats, then there is little companies can do to lock them in. Which is good for me as a dev since I can write software to help users work with that data. Web technologies don't do much to help me there, in-fact for the most part they have made it easier for companies to keep users data locked away on their server in unknown formats or behind proprietary APIs that I don't feel confident building software against. More concisely: email good, Facebook bad; FLAC good, Spotify bad.<p>I'm not arguing against all web sites/apps (or any hypothetical tech stack that offers a similar standard sandboxed environment). For some things it can be appropriate: wikipedia or hacker news or other inherently networked activities for example.  I'd prefer something less byzantine of course, but I expect that if the web apps model does take off then ways of targeting it that mean you don't have to think about CSS or Javascript will get more traction, in the same way that I can write native code without having to worry about assembly (most of the time). Javascript as a compilation target will become ""fast enough"" on most hardware for general purpose things (not for absolutely everything, but that is just another manifestation of the problem of not being able to break outside the sandbox when needed). So the technical issues of css/javascript being horrible are not the main problem.<p>I come from a social science background, which perhaps taints my view here. I look for the power dynamics that limit my real world ability to do things, and don't really care so much about theoretical ideas about a perfect world where everybody works together in harmony to make the web a platform that does everything you could ever need in a timely way. My issue is about power: who controls the APIs that ultimately lets software control your hardware and data? With open native platforms the answer to that is anybody. With the web it's the tech giants alone.",Facebook
2013-03-16 08:36:07,Facebook Cuts Off MessageMes Access To Its Social Graph,"Your argument would be valid, but the scenarios you cite are totally orthogonal. Here's why:<p>1) You don't pay Facebook for their API. If something isn't working, you can't question anyone, nor are they liable to answer you. In short, they are doing you a favor by letting you use their API free of cost.<p>2) A credit card processor like Visa/Mastercard takes your money, and returns you a service instead. IF something isn't working as it should, you can call them and ask them what's wrong and they are liable to answer you, you can even request a refund, failing to provide which you could possibly drag them to a court, which isn't the case with an free API provider like Facebook/Twitter.<p>3) When you integrate the Facebook platform as an additional feature to your site, it's totally fine as long as it doesn't affect the core business model, because even if something gets screwed, users will not worry about a tiny missing feature. But when you build a business on top of someone else's API, be it Twitter or Facebook, it's like building a sand castle at the scale of a real world house and expecting it to be there forever. That's how vulnerable your business model becomes, because there is SO much that you have no control over. In the case of a credit card processor, they don't control your business model, they just do you a service in exchange for money, which is totally different, and you can change providers at a later stage if you find them unsatisfactory, which isn't the case with building something on top of an API like that of Facebook's/Twitter's.",Facebook

The wow factor will wear off after awhile.</i><p>Having developed quite a few apps and websites I find myself agreeing with this thesis - the web will win in the end, not because of any inherent technical advantage (in some ways it's behind mobile apps in terms of performance, look and feel etc), but because the open web has so many advantages for developers and users that in the end it will overcome its disadvantages, and it is of course improving all the time as browsers improve, so the performance gap is narrowing constantly. At some point the performance won't matter, and the advantages of the open web will come to the fore.<p>The contrast between deploying a few fixes a day to a website, and churning out new app versions only to have them rejected by someone at Apple, often for inscrutable and unjustified reasons, then waiting days or weeks for approval, could not be more marked.<p>And as a user, the advantages of the open web (i.e. not walled gardens like Facebook) will I think have an irresistible pull - advantages like linkable, shareable content, content on any device even unforeseen ones, not having to rebuy apps but just subscribing once and using anywhere. The fact that web dev imposes so many limitations is actually a strength, as it means it can be deployed almost anywhere, and give at least some value to users for decades and over any new devices which come out, as opposed to the binaries being created for current mobile platforms, which in a decade will be forgotten.<p>I almost wish Apple had stuck with their first solution of asking developers to use a webkit API on iOS. It would be fascinating to know just exactly how surprised Apple were by the reaction to their suggestion that app developers develop using webkit, and whether they always planned to have a native SDK. At first it certainly seemed like a rushed decision and something they had to scramble to keep up with, and if they'd stuck to HTML it would be interesting to see how the landscape would differ now - perhaps we'd have interoperable apps between mobile devices, rather than the silos we have at present.",Facebook

2013-02-08 00:34:25,Why all my iOS Apps are on hold - or iCloud sucks Part II,"iCloud in general ""just works"". It was pretty terrible from the get-go, from reliability to really egregious bugs in the OS, but at this point is pretty stable.<p>The real problem here is the combination of iCloud and Core Data (for non-Apple folks, the built-in persistence/object model framework).<p>In a somewhat simplified way, Core Data is a data store most commonly backed by SQLite. It's used everywhere from your mail app to the Facebook app. It's handy and convenient when it isn't trying to kill you - it's one of the more complex frameworks that Apple ships, and the documentation is <i>extremely</i> poor for it. It also doesn't help that there is a <i>lot</i> of quirky behavior that's more or less tribal knowledge to long-time Apple devs and WWDC attendees, and is has enough concurrency gotchas to fill a container ship.<p>So, Core Data is not the simplest piece of code to work with from the get-go, and then you pile iCloud on top.<p>iCloud is conceptually pretty simple - there's a directory on your file system that is replicated to Apple's servers, and back down to each one of your devices. When files change the OS sends notifications to your app informing you of such. If you're using iCloud as a distributed file system (a la Dropbox), it's easy to integrate.<p>The trouble with this model is that Core Data stores can be in fact quite large. If you have a 30MB database of, say, recipes on your disk, you really don't want to resend the whole thing every time your user alters a row. Apple special-cases Core Data stores in iCloud by sending only deltas, but the implementation is utterly broken:<p>- There is no baseline state(s). The database is literally the playback of every delta, with no canonical snapshots. Ever.<p>- iCloud is really bad at sequencing the deltas, especially if (somewhat) concurrent changes are happening. Core Data is also <i>terrifyingly bad</i> at conflict resolution when deltas from different devices don't line up.<p>- The above points means that it's <i>trivially easy</i> to break your entire database, as your deltas no longer play back to a sane database file. When this occurs there is no way to roll back your database, since there is no concept of a snapshot or last known good state.<p>- This is compounded by some really horrible API design on Apple's part. When your iCloud database becomes corrupt <i>it fails silently</i>, with absolutely <i>no</i> API that allows one to determine said broken state. Your app literally stops working with none of the OS making a single peep, and no way for you to proactively check your database's state. iCloud seems to print some debug things into your console indicating this failure, but neither your app nor your users have access to it. This manifests in your app (and in tech support requests) as ""iCloud just stopped syncing"" - your device stops transmitting deltas and simply works off of the last locally-cached good state, all without telling the dev or the user.<p>- This is further compounded by the fact that the entirety of Core Data+iCloud was rushed out the door. Documentation was non-existent even up to the day the new version of iOS went out to the public. There was literally only one source of information: a thread on the Apple dev forums that Apple engineers would sometimes pop into.<p>- This is further compounded by the fact that even the Apple engineers themselves seemed to have no idea how to implement an app with iCloud + Core Data. The example code (provided deep, deep within aforementioned thread) made 90 degree turns seemingly every few days. The same sample would have <i>dramatically</i> changing implementations from week to week. The Apple engineers in the thread seemed as mystified as the people trying to use the framework.<p>- The poor documentation and poor state of sample code, as well as what is IMO a fundamentally broken architecture means that iCloud + Core Data remains a complete nightmare to this day. I think the poor architecture is really the core of this here - while Apple could have provided better docs and better support, I believe the fundamental architecture choices made here means Core Data + iCloud would never have been workable.<p>- The icing on top of the cake was an extremely egregious bug that existed at launch (unsure now, you couldn't pay me enough money to work with that API ever again). ""Okay, so our deltas are completely fucked"" you say, ""Why don't we just delete the app's entire iCloud bucket and start over?""<p>A jolly good idea until you realize that a bug in iOS/iCloud means that <i>when you delete an app's iCloud storage ""bin"", it cannot be recreated by that app, ever again</i>.",Facebook

2013-01-31 16:18:28,Funding agencies urged to check for duplicate grants,"Research scientists will soon encounter similar pressures to entrepreneurs who negotiate the Medicare system. The scenario outlined in the article is similar to many of the prosecutions for ""Medicare fraud"".<p>Briefly, Medicare fraud is alleged whenever a business charges a lot to Medicare. This could be due to rapid growth or due to actual fraud, but it's immaterial. And often rapid growth happens due to exploitation of a previously unseen gray area (e.g. Facebook News Feed for Zynga) so regulators usually have an excuse to allege fraud. Unlike FB, they don't just block your API calls; the consequence of a new name appearing at the top of a ""biggest earner list"" is often a meteoric descent from a fast growing business into a federal prosecution.<p>NIH is much nicer than other HHS agencies, as its primary duty is to hand out money rather than enforce regulations. But what happened here is similar. Someone ran analytics to try and figure out which scientists were getting the most money from NIH, and to put some blocks on that in a time of scarce funds. In this case, the issue is that scientists naturally want to avoid duplication of work, and some projects require more funding than the limits of one grant. So they package up the same papers for different agencies with a different spin (bio-terrorism for DoD and bio-remediation for DoE). That's natural and good: leverage your existing work to get more money for the same amount of input. Put another way, this is like selling the same product (your research output) in multiple distribution channels.<p>However, problems arise with third party payment. I don't mind that you got a ""duplicate"" can of Coca Cola, or that the Coke company amortized labor across two different cans. But the government is ostensibly paying on behalf of the public for this work, and its incentives are more to keep scientists employed and to appear egalitarian than to maximize scientific productivity <i>per se</i>. It also wants to award less in grants while seeming ""fair"".<p>In any case, while nothing criminal/civil is being alleged now, I anticipate that grant agencies will make use of software that checks for duplicates in a way to reduce the outflow of money and make it harder for scientists to leverage the same work in multiple channels. The only silver lining here is that some scientists may start to explore non-governmental channels for funding, like patrons in the technology sector, or Kickstarters, or MOOCs, or other vehicles. Another response will be predator/prey like evasions by scientists, to set up grant collaboratives of K people in which the senior author is changed for each application. This will mean no individual scientist appears at the top of a list of ""biggest earners"", and is not targeted for duplication-based denials.",Facebook

2013-01-28 13:18:09,30 pounds in 30 days,"His quote does seem a bit high. In my experience (Rails and iOS developer) if your back end is mostly RESTful resources and a simple data structure, and your front end is standard iOS components like simple tableviews and a NavigationController, you can get an MVP done in the $5k-$10k range in a week or two.<p>HOWEVER: everybody has a different opinion of what is meant by ""Minimum"", ""Viable"", and ""Product"". $5k gets you only bog-standard UI components and a simple data model. Animations? Fancy graphics? Optimized performance? Search? Custom UI? Graceful error handling? Localization/Internationalization/Translation? Integrating with Facebook and dealing with their constant poorly-documented changes to their API? These tend to be little bullet points in the spec, but each on their own can take as much work as the MVP does.<p>With modern tools it's pretty easy to build a basic version of an app quite quickly. But it turns out that most people don't actually want a basic version. Often they have to see the basic version first to realize that, though.<p>So the question ends up being: how important is schedule/cost to you compared with details/performance?<p>To be honest, though, most people who come to me wanting a simple iOS app are better off with a mobile-optimized webapp instead. Much quicker to build, already cross-platform, and no deployment delays while waiting for App Store approval.

2012-02-24 16:45:05,Went Off The Rails: Why I'm Rebuilding Archaeopteryx In CoffeeScript,"Has anyone made a comprehensive comparison of the top web frameworks and how mature the libraries/plug-ins/services around them are?<p>Frankly, Rails and Node.js seem to have much more in common than apart.  Both are based around relatively inconsistent languages (though conforming to some BDD or Good Parts style can help), both have deeply flawed runtimes in terms of performance and especially parallelism, and they seem to have extremely high overlap in the people who program in both frameworks.<p>What I care about is libraries, plug-ins, and services.  Specifically, if I have some new web task, what I care about is that there is some library/plug-in/service that exists to perform that task (e.g., user auth, Facebook API, exception logging, Heroku, resque, state machines), that the library/plug-in/service is mature enough that I can pretend it works, and that it has enough of a community around it that it won't break in the future.<p>Is there some comprehensive list of use cases, plug-ins/libraries/services, and relative maturity of those plug-ins/libraries/services across web frameworks?  For example, the maturity of the various ORMs across frameworks, or the various testing tools, or the various Facebook libraries.  It would be great to see it change over time, and to know when to jump ship to the next flawed language/runtime that has good plug-ins/libraries/services.",Facebook
2012-02-04 01:49:24,Facebook hit git performance issue on large repository,"Three big problems with a split up codebase:<p>1) Instead of doing one large release every week (which facebook does: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10100259101684977"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10100259101684977</a>) you now have dozens or hundreds of smaller releases, a lot more heterogeneity to test for.<p>2) If you have inter-dependencies on modules you have to grapple with the ""diamond dependency"" problem. Say module A depends on module B and C, and suppose that module B also depends on C. However, module B depends on C v2.0 but A depends on C v1.0. If they're all split across repositories it's not possible to update a core API in an atomic commit.<p>3) Now you rely on changes being merged ""up"" to the root and then you have to merge it ""down"" to your project.

AFAIK, Microsoft and Amazon both use the separate repositories model, and Google and Facebook use a single large repository.  Most people I know that have worked at both of these styles prefer the Google/Facebook style.<p>The biggest advantage of a single repository is pretty intangible - it's cultural.  When anyone can change anything or can use any code, people feel like the <i>whole company</i> belongs to them, and they're responsible for Google/Facebook's success as a whole.  People will spontaneously come together to accomplish some user need, and they can refactor to simplify things across component boundaries, and you don't get the sort of political infighting that tends to plague large organizations where people in subprojects never interact with each other.<p>I think if it were my company, I'd want the single repository model, but there need to be tools and practices to manage API complexity.

However, they probably will let the dust settle for a few weeks or few months before spending their cash. At least I hope so.<p>They aren't going to pull a Microsoft and purchase a search company. Google is not as much of a threat really. Search isn't Facebook's expertise <i>and</i> it isn't their market. They would be happy letting Google continue to drive people around for answers on the web, while Facebook will continue to entertain and be friendship/family/work/etc. communication/community focused.<p>So what <i>should</i> they do with it? Focus on communication, community/community needs, and gaming. They need to ensure that they keep the attention of their existing community.<p>As for what to do with the cash:<p>1. Hire some awesome user experience/interface people. And those people need to work on timeline/profile view. The only reason people aren't complaining more about it is that FB like Google does not really provide a customer support experience that makes you feel like they actually care about your opinion individually. If you've ever submitted a bug to FB, you know what I mean. As for the interface, alternating left and right updates on the timeline makes it tougher to read and find things. And the whole feed thing on the right needs to go away. There should be a single feed page and a single profile page with controls to change filtering on posts. That is so obvious and ubiquitous elsewhere, so failing to provide a good interface for status updates when that is basically the point is ridiculous.<p>2. Hire some better folks to lead up API development. It is a huge mess right now. Too many APIs that don't all do the same thing, and breaking Javascript API with changes. Not cool.<p>3. For M&#38;A, focus on bringing resources onboard for community, ratings and reviews, e-commerce focus. They could easily compete with Amazon and/or eBay within the existing social/community framework and it is a better idea for business than simply referrals, advertising, and selling imaginary sheep for people's imaginary farms.",Facebook

If they don't, the community should just hack up a new one. The Facebook API changes every week and breaks every other week in 1 thing or another anyway.

Right now, people dont seem to care about privacy all that much, and I can't blame them.
Every time the privacy debate comes up in relation to google or facebook the conversation is steered towards the following assumptions:<p><pre><code>  - The attacker is another member of the website or an anonymous web user.
  - The platform (gmail or facebook) is a trusted third party.
</code></pre>
This is not the debate I want to be having. I don't agree with the second assumption. Any privacy policy I can fill out for my data will not prevent the company from accessing my data. They own the database and the file servers and even have authority over my login credentials for that website.<p>What about the privacy in the following paradigm:<p><pre><code>   - The attacker can be any person or company on the internet.
   - Your server is a VM in a distributed platform of hosts.
   - You have a special credential (id-rsa), which is used to change settings on the VM.  
   - Host can be trusted most of the time, but sometimes (prob=0.2) they are malicious.

If we ensure there is a big ecosystem of hosting companies with a compatible API, then individual users could constantly migrate their hosting plans and change companies every month, or even every week. Thus in the worst case, a ""cloud host"" could eavesdrop on you just for one week.

2011-11-12 19:57:50,Flash is dead. Long live the internet.,"I felt the exact same way for a very, very long time. A few things changed my mind.<p>The first was the realization that Adobe wasn't going to make any more cool fun stuff for me. I feel like they've just lost their way with all that and now that I look back on it, it seems like Macromedia actually made all the aspects of Flash that I enjoy. The most recent thing Adobe has done for me is Stage3D but even that is so technical that they're relying on 3rd parties like Away3D to build the friendly API on top of it.<p>The second was doing a project that was as close to an art piece as I've ever come doing ad agency work that was entirely in HTML/CSS3 and JS. It was actually this project if you want to see some pictures: <a href=""http://inchwormstudio.com/?portfolio=samsung-coast-to-coast-photo-post"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inchwormstudio.com/?portfolio=samsung-coast-to-coast-...</a>
What I found while I was doing that project was that the web has changed a lot while I've been doing Flash and I didn't realize how much annoying obtuse boilerplate I had to write in AS3 that just becomes total cake when you're using HTML for markup, CSS for style and JS for slick transitions and communication. My main love affair is with HTML and JS, I still think CSS is...CSS. With HTML I'm getting all the great structural stuff that Flex devs love, without the mind numblingly elaborate class structures they have to deal with. With good JS libraries like jQuery I'm getting the cross browser DOM support that I need because I just don't have those sea legs yet. And when you combine it all you can work really, really fast. I spent the whole first half of that project cursing JavaScript up and down the office. I would make little examples showing how setInterval loses scope and demo it for my team and be like ""look! this stuff is retarded! I want AS3 back!"" Then one day I had to build this twitter widget, and I sat down and I just cranked it out in no time. And I thought, 'You know, if I had been doing this in Flash I would have spent so much time dealing with URLLoaders and cross policy files and coreLib for JSON parsing...' It just felt like things had gone smoother because I wasn't fighting against the web to make it fit inside my Flash app. And that was about the time that I felt like I got over the hump, and from there it was all downhill.<p>It totally had warts and I got stung by IE transparency bugs but in the end we sorted it all out and now I know how to deal with those issues. And to be honest, they were pretty minimal. The Facebook API was far worse than the cross browser stuff.<p>If you're making the transition then read this: <a href=""http://jqfundamentals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqfundamentals.com/</a>
I read it start to finish and it made things so much easier for me. Then once you're comfortable with jQuery, leave it behind and try the other stuff.

This unique plugin is authorized to request keys for messages for your Trusted Contacts and generate new keys associated with your account.<p>The keys are generated in parallel on the client and on the key management server. They are always rolling forward and are synced with the key management server in real-time utilizing a few unique variables within your custom plugin and a few generated randomly each time.<p>No two messages are encrypted with the same key and keys are only stored in memory during the encryption / decryption process. Every time a message or photo that has been protected is viewed, either by yourself or others, authorization to that messages key is requested from the key management server.<p>Your Trusted Contact list is managed globally by connecting with other users through Social Fortress. Within Facebook all of your friends are initially treated as Trusted Contacts and you can easily remove individuals from this list with the click of a button.<p>Social Fortress uses AES-256 CTR for the encryption and communicates over a 256 SSL stream from your device to the key management server. The data in this stream is also encrypted using aspects of your customized installation.<p>The technology for web services (Facebook, Google+) operates as browser plugin for Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer[1] and independent of any service's API.<p>The technology for Thunderbird and Outlook is a separate plugin which requires installation.<p>We integrate transparently into the products we support so the user experience is exactly the same. No extra clicks, no confusing decisions and nothing extra to learn. We designed Social Fortress to be used by individuals who don't even know what the word encryption is.<p>Within every environment you have the ability to enable / disable Social Fortress protection with the click of a button or using a keyboard shortcut (CTRL+Q). This only disables the encryption functions. The reader is always on so messages and photos protected by your friends appear normal without you having to protect your own. It's like having Flash or PDF Reader once it is installed you don't ever have to do anything again.<p>If your device becomes compromised / lost / whatever you can login to the site and disable all active installations in two clicks and this will not affect previously encrypted messages as we just disable authorization access to your old plugins and have no need to change any previously generated keys.<p>We also support other services but have yet to make them live:<p>Skype Chat<p>Twitter<p>mail.yahoo.com<p>Gmail.com<p>Chatter.com<p>Yammer.com<p>Blackberry Native Email support<p>[1] The IE Plugin is not currently part of the public beta.",Facebook

That's starting to change, but a lot of functionality and support is still missing. The phase-out of free promotional credits (for which developers were not paid), which was originally slated to occur on February 15th, is ongoing. A functional reporting and management interface for Credits partners would be very welcome - currently this consists of an incomplete API and two .tsv files (a detailed list and a digest of transactions for the previous day) automatically emailed to publishers nightly. These emails started being sent about six weeks ago. There is currently no mechanism for responding to disputed payments or fraud claims but they say they're working on it.<p>There are positive aspects to Credits though. We see decent adoption but still process many more transactions and many more dollars (at a much lower fee, it's worth reiterating!) through Paypal. The checkout flow is pretty good, and while some people are less trusting of Facebook, some already regard them as a trustworthy steward of CC info, and the latter group is probably more closely aligned with target audiences than the former.<p>I'd say that right now (and at least until off-site, FB Connect implementations of Credits has been in use for months), it's a question of whether your project requires the other benefits of building on Facebook - user data, social hooks, etc - to the extent that it's worth swallowing the fee &#38; quirks of the platform.

Half of that was with no progress. The documentation sucks. The forums are barren. I've read post after post about breaking changes. What am I getting myself into.<p>I've spent over 5 hours trying to access my friends relationship status and cant get it to work. If anyone can help I would really appreciate it.

It's really a joke for a company of that size. It has become kind of a running gag in the office (like: ""Skip the tests, just release it. Today we do it facebook-style"")",Facebook

Maybe I should go back and fix it and open source it.<p>Not sure what Facebook's policies say about these sort of notifications though.",Facebook

My mother-in-law to be suggested it would be nice to know when the relationship was over (jokingly). I blurted out that I could make something that could do that in a couple of hours. By then, I knew I had to do it.<p>The application was built on Google Appengine, Django, and the Facebook Graph API. I'm checking for status changes every 24 hours, and am using the Appengine mail service to send emails whenever I notice that a relationship status has changed.<p>Seriously, this is mostly a joke. But enjoy, if you do choose to use it for real.",Facebook
2011-02-09 03:14:13,Rate my startup: Adore.ly,"Hey,<p>Initially, we had a ""wall posting"" feature. User signs up via facebook and it will give them an option to post on their wall. However, I realized that if we require wall posting permission right up the front, that would really put off a lot of people. You see facebook doesn't allow us to change permission half way and this is one of the drawbacks of the facebook API (even if you like it, you can't force a permission change).",Facebook

The current solution, where you email a large file in HTML format is not an acceptable solution.  Good for archiving, bad for data portability.<p>Most importantly, though, a clear change (or clear guidelines) to the Terms Of Service which would guarantee that moving your data to a competing service would not result in cancellation of the account or deletion of the new service's API key.<p>As for a distributed protocol, take a look at the functionality in Appleseed's QuickSocial and StatusNet for an idea of what a distributed protocol entails.  I should be able to login to facebook with an external identity, and add someone as a friend on facebook, without having an actual facebook account.<p>If Facebook is interested in these things, you can have some representatives join the Federated Social Web mailing list, and you can support the W3C working group on federated social networking, as well as supporting the Data Portability Project.",Facebook
