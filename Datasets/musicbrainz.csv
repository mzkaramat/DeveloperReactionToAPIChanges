"Musicbrainz fingerprinting","<p>I've been busy with understanding the <a href=""http://musicbrainz.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">MusicBrainz</a> database in the past few hours and as I noticed there's no command line application to tag or fingerprint audio files. Are there any CLI implementations on Musicbrainz's fingerprinting? And how can I create those fingerprints?</p>

<p>I found some <a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Products#Developer_resources"" rel=""noreferrer"">development tools</a> on their website (python-musicbrainz2, libdiscid and the XML webs service) but I couldn't find a simple tool or app which creates those fingerprints (the developments tools only seem to be useful for retrieving track/artist information using a fingerprint). Am I understanding something wrong?</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

"How to use existing java data bindings in grails?","<p>I need to add a new datasource to my grails project wich uses the musicbrainz postgresql database. <a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database"" rel=""nofollow"">http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database</a></p>

<p>Am i able to use these data bindings in a grails 2.2.3 project? If yes, how can i do this? (because there is no hibernate xml as needed by grails (regarding to the grails documentation: Hibernate Mapped Domain Classes))</p>

"PostgreSQL 9.3 Import dump into table psql newbie frustration","<p>I am working on Windows Server 2008 with the musicbrainz database dump. I unzipped the dump no problem and there are about 60 files with no extension whose names mirror the database tables.</p>

<p>I managed to get a createtables sql script I found at the github to work and I have a database schema with empty tables that mirror the files that I unzipped.</p>

<p>The problem is I am at the psql command line interface and I figured out how to issue the large object import command as per</p>

<p>\lo_import 'path/filename'</p>

<p>It seems to work because the files are very large and the moment I execute the CPU light starts blinking like mad. The problem is back in Postgres after I refresh my db the tables are still empty. I have no idea where that data goes if anywhere. </p>

<p>I am a straight up windows programmer (.NET/SQL/JQuery) so I need someone who can explain what's going on from this perspective. Explaining what works in unix or linux or anything other than windows will not be helpful I am afraid.</p>

"Locating the mbid for various tracks with musicbrainzws2-java","<p>I have imported the musicbrainzws2-java library into my project and I have been reading through the documentation that MusicBrainz has on their web service. It is very confusing though. I was wondering if someone could help me understand how to navigate through the MusicBrainz data base. I don't understand the terminology and my main goal of using the database is to gather the mbid's for various songs.</p>

<p>Right now this is what I have.</p>

<pre><code>    public static void main(String[] args) {

    ArtistSearchFilterWs2 filter = new ArtistSearchFilterWs2();

    filter.setArtistName(""Lindsey Stirling"");
    filter.setLimit((long) 100);
    filter.setMinScore((long) 0);
    filter.setOffset((long) 0);

    ArtistSearchWs2 search = new ArtistSearchWs2(filter);

    List&lt;ArtistResultWs2&gt; result = search.getFullList();

    /*
    for(ArtistResultWs2 artist : result) {
        System.out.println(artist.getArtist().getName() + "" "" + i);
        i++;

        if(artist.getArtist().getName() == ""Lindsey Stirling"") {

            System.out.println(artist.getArtist().getName() + "" "" + i);
            break;
        }

    }
    */

    String artistName = result.get(0).getArtist().getName();
    System.out.println(artistName);

    List&lt;ReleaseWs2&gt; releases = result.get(0).getArtist().getReleaseList().getReleases();

    System.out.println(releases.size());

    for(ReleaseWs2 release : releases) {
        System.out.println(release.getTitle());

    }
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason it says that there are 0 releases for the artist Lindsey Stirling and on top of that I don't know how to search for a specific song based off of an artist and album</p>

"Get tracklist of album with MusicBrainz ID","<p>I'm currently using the <a href=""https://github.com/mikealmond/MusicBrainz/"" rel=""nofollow"">mikealmond/MusicBrainz</a> class to get the info I need from the wonderful MusicBrainz database.</p>

<p>But I have one problem, I need to get recordings off a release, I've found how to do it on the web API here in the browser via this url: musicbrainz(dot)org/ws/2/release/61bf0388-b8a9-48f4-81d1-7eb02706dfb0?inc=recordings</p>

<p>But in the class I'm using they require that I add a entity before I add the ID of the release, but I don't know what to add. And if I try to take it away I just end up with a url like this:
musicbrainz(dot)org/ws/2/release/?=61bf0388-b8a9-48f4-81d1-7eb02706dfb0?inc=recordings and that doesn't work.
Is there a entity I can add to say that I'm giving the release mbid?</p>

<p>Or maybe someone could help me change the class I'm using to make this work, I've tried doing it myself but failed.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I've tried to contact the author with no luck.</p>

<p>I've tried this code from the class mentioned above:</p>

<pre><code>$includes = array('recordings');
try {
    $details = $brainz-&gt;browseRelease('61bf0388-b8a9-48f4-81d1-7eb02706dfb0', $includes, 2);

"Filter fetched JSON data based on a certain criteria in Python","<p>I am new to python and am trying to fetch JSON data from musicbrainz using urllib and am able to parse some data. However, for some artists, certain fields / keys in the JSON data do not come as they might not be required.

<p>In the below example, I will need to filter the fetched JSON data only for the ones that have release-list>>release>>release-group>>type as 'Single'. The JSON fetched can have iterations up to 50 at times, but I only feed to further filter this to just the ones that were category 'Single'. Please let me know how one can go about. Thanks!</p>

"Perl: How to retrieve album metadata from MusicBrainz?","<p>I am creating a Perl script which will move a mp3 file to my music folder in format <code>artist/album/mp3file</code>. Now it is possible that some of my mp3 files don't have an <code>album tag</code> so I thought of querying the <a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">MusicBrainz</a> database to retrieve album metadata given <code>track title &amp; artist</code>.</p>

<p>I am using <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~bfaist/WebService-MusicBrainz-0.93/lib/WebService/MusicBrainz.pm"" rel=""nofollow"">WebService::MusicBrainz</a> Perl module for this task, but I am not able to see any method that gives album metadata info. My current code is:</p>

<pre><code>use WebService::MusicBrainz::Track;

my $ws = WebService::MusicBrainz::Track-&gt;new();
my $response = $ws-&gt;search({ ARTIST =&gt; 'Ryan Adams', TITLE =&gt; 'when the stars go blue'  }); 

my $track = $response-&gt;track();
print $track-&gt;title(), "" - "", $track-&gt;artist()-&gt;name(), ""\n"";

say $track-&gt;id();
</code></pre>

<p>So, how do I get my the album info for a given track using MusicBrainz and if it is not possible what are my alternative options?</p>

"Plugin not working on MusicBrainz v1.2","<p>As an exercise for learning, I am trying to write a plugin for MusicBrainz that matches the <code>albumartistsort</code> to <code>albumartist</code> and <code>artistsort</code> to <code>artist</code>, as opposed to the (apparently) default of <strong>Last Name, First Name</strong> format it is currently using.</p>

<p>I am just learning about Python and therefore I am trying to use another plugin as a guide, but some important changes need to be done and that's where I probably screwed up.</p>

<p>When I try installing the plug in, it doesn't appear in the plugin list although it is copied to the plugin folder; and the <code>.pyo</code> file is not generated. I am guessing this is due to a compilation error, but I haven't been able to include whatever I need so I can use the <code>picard</code> module (don't know where to find it nor import it) so I can test in my python interpreter.</p>

<p>This is the code I have:</p>

<pre><code>PLUGIN_NAME = ""Sort Artist and Album Artist""
PLUGIN_AUTHOR = ""Kevin Hernandez""
PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION = ""Sorts artist/album artist by name as in Artist/Album Artist field instead of Last, First""
PLUGIN_VERSION = ""0.1""
PLUGIN_API_VERSIONS = [""0.9.0"", ""0.10"", ""0.15"", ""0.16""]

from picard.metadata import register_album_metadata_processor
import re

def copy_albumartist_to_albumartistsort(tagger, metadata, release):
  match = re.search($not($eq(metadata[""albumartistsort""],metadata[""albumartist""])))
    if match:
        metadata[""albumartistsort""] = metadata[""albumartist""]

def copy_artist_to_artistsort(tagger, metadata, release):
  match = re.search($not($eq(metadata[""artistsort""],metadata[""artist""])))
    if match:
        metadata[""artistsort""] = metadata[""artist""]

register_album_metadata_processor(copy_albumartist_to_albumartistsort)
register_album_metadata_processor(copy_artist_to_artistsort)
</code></pre>

<p>and I also tried defining the functions as:</p>

<pre><code>def copy_albumartist_to_albumartistsort(tagger, metadata, release):
  metadata[""albumartistsort""] = metadata[""albumartist""]

def copy_artist_to_artistsort(tagger, metadata, release):
  metadata[""artistsort""] = metadata[""artist""]
</code></pre>

<p>I must point out that I don't fully understand when these are called. I believe the plugin documentation <a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Picard/Plugins/API"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, <a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Picard/Documentation/Scripting"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Picard/Tags"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> is not enough to follow the plugins they have there (e.g. the <code>search</code> and <code>match</code> methods they use in different plugins with <code>re</code> are not explained in the documentation links I am referring to.</p>

<p>If there's a more thorough documentation for it, you can pinpoint what I am doing wrong in my code, or know how to include the <code>picard</code> module in an interpreter (where to find it AND how to include it), then your comments are very much appreciated and valid answers to this question.</p>

"How to get information about the series a release belongs to via Musicbrainz","<p>I plan to extend the music library manager <a href=""http://beets.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">beets</a>, which relies on Musicbrainz as backend.</p>

<p>What I want to do is find out the Series a Compilation belongs to given the MBID of the compilation.
When you open a release in the WEB-Interface, the ""release group"" is written at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>For example there is <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/release/bfaa7806-0628-4e81-a553-b88e379b6c3b"" rel=""nofollow"">Bravo Hits 45</a>.
It belongs to the series <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/series/1350fce9-08ab-40ba-a7bb-ed3cfb869499"" rel=""nofollow"">Bravo Hits</a> and is no 45.</p>

<p>But how do I get this information given the MBID e.g. <code>bfaa7806-0628-4e81-a553-b88e379b6c3b</code> of a release using the XML-API?</p>

<p>(PS: I am not 100% sure if keywords <code>series</code> and <code>release-group</code> have anything in common.)</p>

<p>I tried to request metadata to include series relations and collection information:
<code>http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release/bfaa7806-0628-4e81-a553-b88e379b6c3b?inc=series-rels+collections</code> 
No information.</p>

<p>Or maybe via release group?
<code>http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release-group?release=bfaa7806-0628-4e81-a553-b88e379b6c3b</code> 
No information.</p>

<p>I thought there should even be a browse request for series, but this query doesn't even exist:
<code>https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/series?release=1350fce9-08ab-40ba-a7bb-ed3cfb869499</code></p>

<p>Anyway, I could do a query using the name, getting a lot of inexact results including the right one:
<code>https://musicbrainz.org/search?query=Bravo+Hits+45&amp;type=series&amp;method=indexed</code></p>

<p><strong>But I guess there should be a way, to do an exact lookup using the MBID of the release, right?</strong></p>

"Manage with limit and offset in php","<p>I am currently developing a web application that will find artists and their associates titles.

<p>Suppose I already have the artist mbid (unique identifier for MusicBrainz).</p>

<p>The problem is that if I do a search on David Guetta (<code>mbid = 302bd7b9-d012-4360-897a-93b00c855680</code>) for example, the script tells me that the number of releases is 196. However, the API provides 100 maximum results per request.</p>

<pre><code>// Instantiate a MusicBrainz object
$brainz = new MusicBrainz(new GuzzleHttpAdapter(new Client()));
$brainz-&gt;setUserAgent('ApplicationName', '0.2', 'http://example.com');

$limit = 100;
$offset = 0;

$includes = array('labels', 'recordings');
try {
  $details = $brainz-&gt;browseRelease('artist', '302bd7b9-d012-4360-897a-93b00c855680', $includes, $limit, $offset);
  print_r($details);
} catch (Exception $e) {
  print $e-&gt;getMessage();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function <strong><code>browseRelease</code></strong> below allows us to define such parameters as <strong><code>limit</code></strong> and <strong><code>offset</code></strong>.</p>

<pre><code>public function browseRelease($entity, $mbid, $includes = array(), $limit = 25, $offset = null, $releaseType = array(), $releaseStatus = array())

  if (!in_array($entity, array('artist', 'label', 'recording', 'release-group'))) {

  );
}

<p>Now we come to my real question in this post.</p>

<p>If I defined <code>$limit = 100</code> and <code>$offset = 0</code> for the first query, I don't understand how to change these values depending on the number of total releases, and thus get the results that are between 100 and 196 (in this example).</p>

"How to get an Album's MusicBrainz ID","<p>I want to use the <a href=""https://github.com/lastfm/coverartarchive-api"" rel=""nofollow"">CoverArtArchiveClient</a> to load Album Images from MusicBrainz but it requires a MusicBrainz ID (<a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier"" rel=""nofollow"">MBID</a>). Can someone provide info on how to get the MBID for a particular Album? Code samples would be much appreciated.</p>

"Musicbrainz database - MySQL lasts too much time to delete or insert","<p>I am trying to import the <strong>Musicbrainz</strong> db into a MySQL database using Perl scripts from <a href=""https://github.com/hangar18cc/mbzdb"" rel=""nofollow"">Churruka</a>, not the ""official"" ones due to not working properly (I consulted <a href=""https://github.com/elliotchance/mbzdb/issues/68"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>).</p>

<p>Now I have inserted all the tables except 'recording', whose size is <strong>1.39 GB</strong>. I have tried to insert the downloaded file two times. However, the insertions lasts too much and I'm afraid some configuration is not correctly set in MySQL. I just downloaded it for this import, so no more databases are present.</p>

<p>Both times, something happened to my laptop so I had to restart the process. I deleted all the rows from the 'recording' table to restart again, but the process lasts sooooo many seconds. Currently is <strong>above 110000s</strong> !!!</p>

<p>Any idea of how this process could be speeded up? Thanks in advance</p>

"Using AcoustID API in Android app","<p>I want to make an Android app that uses <code>AcoustID</code> API. From my understanding that is a c++ API and i should use Android NDK for this. The curious thing is that i found a sample of this API written in Java and i don't know if this is actually AcoustID API or some adaptation. </p>

<p>Also if using AcoustID means that i have to use NDK i would like to know if there is a Java alternative for it. I couldn't find satisfying results.</p>

"How to tag the correct release or a recording using MusicBrainz?","<p>I'm using the xml web service of MusicBrainz to fetch as much data as I can about every recording that I have. When quering Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen for example. What I get is this:<a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording/ebf79ba5-085e-48d2-9eb8-2d992fbf0f6d?inc=artist-credits%2Breleases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording/ebf79ba5-085e-48d2-9eb8-2d992fbf0f6d?inc=artist-credits%2Breleases.</a>
You can see that I get all the releases of the recording that are out there. </p>

<p>What I want is to know how can i distinguish between them. Which of them is the one that belongs to my release. </p>

<p>I know there must be some way to aproach this since the lookup tool in MusicBrainz Picard gives me only one of them. And its usually one from the middle and not from the beggining. Meaning there is some mechanizem that can pin-point the correct release. </p>

<p>Any ideas how its doing it?</p>

"How to sort results from the MusicBrainz search API","<p>I'm trying to retrieve track information from the MusicBrainz API, using only the artist and title as search queries:</p>

<pre><code>http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording/?query=artist:Coldplay+AND+recording:The+Scientist
</code></pre>

<p>This will return every version of the song that the artist released, including  compilations, 'best of' albums and live recordings. I want to find the 'original' version, which should be the first one that was released.</p>

<p>Without retrieving every single result (which may not be possible in a single request) the obvious way to do this would be to have the response sorted by ascending release date, so that the first result is always the one I'm after.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2/Search"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">API documentation</a> doesn't seem to mention sorting results, so is this possible?</p>

"Filter results from browse_release_groups by artist_id to get discography, python","<p>I'm trying to retrieve discographies for various artists. Wikipedia and the manual web interface for MusicBrainz.org seem to agree on what albums make this up, for the artists I've checked. My first thought was to attempt to screen-scrape either of these resources, but that looks like hard work to do it properly.</p>

<p>Direct queries of the musicbrainz data seemed to offer a quicker way to get clean data. I would ideally construct a request like this ...</p>

<pre><code>data = get_release_groups(artist=mbid,
                          primary_type='Album',
                          status='Official',
                          includes=['first_release_date',
                                    'title',
                                    'secondary_type_list'])
</code></pre>

<p>I chose to use the python wrapper musicbrainsngs, as I am fairly experienced with python. It gave me a choice of three methods, get_, search_ and browse_. Get_ will not return sufficient records. Browse_ appeared to be what I wanted, so I tried that first, especially as search_ was documented around looking for text in the python examples, rather than the mb_id, which I already had.</p>

<p>When I did a browse_release_groups(artist=artist_id,,,), I got a list of release groups, each containing the data I wanted, which was album title, type and year. However, I also got a large number of other release groups that don't appear on their manual web results for (for example The Rolling Stones) <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/artist/b071f9fa-14b0-4217-8e97-eb41da73f598"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://musicbrainz.org/artist/b071f9fa-14b0-4217-8e97-eb41da73f598</a></p>

<p>There didn't appear to be any way to filter in the query for status='official', or to include the status as part of the results so I could manually filter.</p>

<p>In response to this question, Wieland has suggested I use the search_ query. I have tested search_release_groups(arid=mbid, status='official', primarytype='Album', strict=True, limit=...) and this returns many fewer release groups. As far as studio albums are concerned, it matches 1:1. There are still a few minor discrepancies in the compilations, which I can live with. However, this query did not return the first-release-date, and so far, it has been resistant to my attempts to find how to include it. I notice in the server search code linked to that every query starts off manipulating rgm.first_release_date_year etc, but it's not clear how/when this gets returned from a query.</p>

<p>It's just occurred to me that I can use both a browse_ and a search_ , as together they give me all the information. So I have a work around, but it feels rather agricultural. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I want release groups (titles, dates, types, status) by artist ID. If I browse, I get dates, but can't include or filter by status. If I search, I can filter by status, but don't get dates. How can I get both in one query?</p>

"Querying MusicBrainz search API via PHP script","<p>I'm trying to retrieve release info from the MusicBrainz database using a PHP script on my server. I have a list of songs, with song title and artist name, and I'm trying to retrieve the date of the first release of that song, along with other info about that release.</p>

<p>I realise that the search won't always be 100% accurate, but the list consists of fairly rare and unique songs so it should at least get me on a good track.</p>

<p>I've gotten pretty far with my script, it returns results and everything, but I'm unsure about how to write the query exactly. The documentation is quite confusing and doesn't feature an example where you search for both song title and artist.</p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>// this info is normally fetched from my DB, but just as a simple example (as it is returned):
$artist = ""ZZTop""; 
$song_title = ""It's only Love"";

// I'm having trouble with this part:
$mb_query = 'http://www.musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording?query=' . $song_title .' ANDartist:' . $artist ;

$xml = simplexml_load_file($mb_query);

$releasedate = $xml-&gt;{'recording-list'}-&gt;recording[0]-&gt;{'release-list'}-&gt;release[0]-&gt;date;
</code></pre>

<p>At first I've tried to <code>rawurlencode()</code> the <code>$artist</code> and <code>$song_title</code>, but funnily enough, that didn't return any results, so I figured I'd just leave it as a plain string. The query returns results, but they are really off and I have the feeling only part of the query is getting picked up (for instance only the song title and not the artist).</p>

"Musicbrainz querying artist and release","<p>I am trying to get an artist and their albums. So reading this page <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2</a> i created the following query to get Michael Jackson's albums</p>

<pre><code>http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/?query=artist:michael%20jackson?inc=releases+recordings
</code></pre>

<p>My understanding is to add <code>?inc=releases+recordings</code> at the end of the URL which should return Michael Jackson's albums however this doesnt seem to return the correct results or i cant seem to narrow down the results? I then thought to use the <code>{MBID}</code> but again thats not returned in the artists query (which is why im trying to use <code>inc</code> in my query)</p>

<pre><code>http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/?query=artist:michael%20jackson
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone suggest where im going wrong with this?</p>

"Getting a tracklist from MusicBrainz","<p>I am trying to learn Python, and thought I'd learn by writing something I'd actually use. SO I'm trying to write a little script to rip some music CDs.</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python

musicbrainzngs.set_useragent(""Audacious"", ""0.1"", ""https://github.com/jonnybarnes/audacious"")

parser.add_argument(""--cdrom"", help=""provide the source of the cd"", default=""/dev/cdrom"")

device = args.cdrom

print(""device: %s"" % device)
disc = discid.read(device)
print(""id: %s"" % disc.id)

try:
    result = musicbrainzngs.get_releases_by_discid(disc.id, includes=[""artists""])
except musicbrainzngs.ResponseError:
    print(""disc not found or bad response"")
else:

"Perform substitution on regex results, but only on a given condition","<p>First of all, let me please clarify that I know absolutely nothing about regular expressions, but I need to write a ""Tagger Script"" for MusicBrainz Picard so that it doesn't mess with the way I format certain aspects of my tracks' titles.</p>

<p>Here's what I need to do:
- Find all sub-strings inside parenthesis
- Then, for those matches that meet a given criteria and those matches only, change the parentheses to brackets</p>

<p>For example, consider this string:
DJ Fresh - Louder (Sian Evans) (Flux Pavilion &amp; Doctor P Remix)</p>

<p>It needs to be changed like so:
DJ Fresh - Louder (Sian Evans) [Flux Pavilion &amp; Doctor P Remix]</p>

<p>The condition is that if the string within the parentheses contains the sub-string ""dj"" or ""mix"" or ""version"" or ""inch"", etc... then the parentheses surrounding it need to be changed to brackets.</p>

<p>So, the question is:
Is it possible to create a single regex expression that can perform this operation?</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>im interested in getting for each recording its work id.
now i tried adding 'recording-rels' to the includes but it seems only to return relationship between release and recording.
I also tried adding 'recording-level-rels' to includes as mentioned <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2#Relationships"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>
where it states that it should return recordings relationships, but when i try using it - i get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{""error"":""recording-level-rels is not a valid inc parameter for the release resource.""}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I using it wrongly?
To clarify, i'm after the relationship that you get from their site, say from <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/release/8e602038-c0f2-3c2d-9068-a1a3daca493d"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>, where each release has recording of that contains a link to the musicbrainz work id page.</p>

<p>Any help\advice would be very appreciated,

"RESTful media types for audio/music collection service (with metadata)","<p>I have a large music collection, composed of mp3 files, flac files, and others.  I would like to share it with devices on my local network and computers I am using on remote networks.  It seems to me that HTTP is eminently well-suited to the sharing of files and I wonder if there's anything saner than uPNP (a.k.a DLNA) that my server could implement so that a suitable client could find out what's on the server and query information like track title, artist, composer, cd cover artwork, etc etc - the kind of stuff that would be stored in ID3 tags for an mp3 file.</p>

<p>(My experience of uPNP is limited, but I know it's SOAP-based, which makes me suspicious that it has any good in it, and I know that almost all the googling I've done on it has returned other peoples libraries rather than discussion of the protocol itself, which is another red flag)</p>

<p>(I know also of DAAP, the Itunes format, but that's proprietary and it would appear that Apple like to break it whenever anyone else catches up.  Not so wild about that either)</p>

<p>Any pointers? </p>

"MusicBrainz Server Update","<p>I successfully installed a freshly downloaded virtual instance a few days ago, running in VirtualBox on Windows 10. Seems to be working fine. Noticed that under 'Statistics' on the home page is was dated April 2016. Configured with a key for replication, ran 'bin/replicate start' and now the Statistics page update is 05/22/16. Interestingly the mirror <a href=""http://musicbrainz-mirror.eu:5000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://musicbrainz-mirror.eu:5000/</a> shows the same 05/22/16 date.</p>

<p>It seems the database schema changed on 05/23/16 (<a href=""https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/05/25/schema-change-release-2016-05-23-with-upgrade-instructions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/05/25/schema-change-release-2016-05-23-with-upgrade-instructions/</a>) but the virtual machine available for download is dated 2015-08-06 on <a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Server/Setup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Server/Setup</a></p>

<p>So automatic updating stops at 5/22 with the current virtual machine. Seems to make sense but where is the latest virtual machine build, or is that left to the user to build from the GitHub repository?</p>

"How can you access the original tag or filename text in a mp3 with a MusicBrainz: Picard plugin?","<p>I am trying to access the filename or MetaData I have added to my music over the years. (Live), (Demo), (Live: In Athens), (Acoustic), (Live In Las Vegas 2005), (Metallica Cover), (Bonus Track), etc. I've done this to distinguish between tracks easily.  </p>

<p>I an going through trying to fix my music and organize/tag it better with MusicBrainz Picard. But Picard doesn't allow access to the original Tags, or Filename. Relying only on what is pulled from their database. (As you can see my info isn't standard. and it's just for me and my own personal collection, so most of it, would be useless to add to their database)</p>

<p>So one of the Forum Admins/Programmers (I think), Suggested that maybe it was possible to do this through a plugin.</p>

<p>I've never programmed in Python, and don't know the first thing about it. lately i've barely been getting into RegEx. But have a Fairly decent, though not advanced understanding of that. </p>

<p>Now, Ideally I'd like to check the original metadata if possible, and then check the filename. and pull out anything in () and save it to a Several Variables in the file as they are there: ExtraInfo1, ExtraInfo2, etc. then check each against the title to make sure it's not already in the title as sometimes the titles themselves have parentheses in their titles. then if not, be able to add them back to the title. to tag and rename them.</p>

<p>I did find this plugin, which pulls information out of the title and moves it to the version tag. So that is almost exactly what i'm looking for, except instead of taking it from the Title tag, i'd like to take it from the original title tag, or the filename. then add it to the new Title tag.</p>

<p>Could someone maybe help me with this?</p>

"PHP MusicBrainz get the first release date","<p>i am trying to get the first release date of a song using Musicbrainz. To get this i am using the mikealmond musicBrainz library.</p>

<p>The problem i have is that when i try to execute exactly the same code as in this example (<a href=""https://github.com/mikealmond/MusicBrainz/blob/master/examples/first-recording-search.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mikealmond/MusicBrainz/blob/master/examples/first-recording-search.php</a>) i always get an authentication error.</p>

<p>Therefore i tried to add my username and password to the request:</p>

<pre><code>$brainz = new MusicBrainz(new GuzzleHttpAdapter(new Client()),'myusername','mypassword');

<p>If i call the url in the error message manually and enter my username and password i get the array i expect.</p>

<p>I just had a discovery: If I removed -<code>""+ user - ratings""</code>- it does not require authentication. </p>

<p>Therefore i commented the lines with <code>""user - ratings""</code> in my project </p>

<p><strong>Now i think it works, but the performance of the query is very bad and often i get Error 503 // The MusicBrainz web server is currently busy. Please try again later. //

"How to compare two releases in a MusicBrainz Picard plugin?","<p>I have been trying to write a Picard plugin. My idea is for it to automatically insert transliterated track listings as comments for releases with track titles written in non-Latin scripts. MusicBrainz contains these transliterations as pseudo-releases existing in parallel with the actual releases. For <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/release/1492ce2b-a9ee-4aa3-b9e2-b18ad093bc51"" rel=""nofollow"">a given release</a>, for example, I would have to first read the relation for the ID of the related release. I would then have to transfer the titles of those tracks into the comment field of my files. In pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>pseudo_release = actual_release.getTransliteration() # As indicated in a relationship
i = 1
while i &lt;= actual_release.numTracks():
    actual_release.getTrack(i).setComment(pseudo_release.getTrack(i).getTitle())
    i++
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is what I'm not sure how to do. Since the relation is not available as a Picard variable, it can't be accessed by any way indicated in the API.</p>

<p>I've been looking through the source of Picard and also <a href=""http://python-musicbrainzngs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#"" rel=""nofollow"">the standalone web service</a> but haven't been able to find anything. Is this at all possible, and if so how do I do it?</p>

"MusicBrainz API search provides different results from web page","<p>I'm trying to work with <em>MusicBrainz</em>'s API but I'm having some issues with the results of the <em>search</em> endpoint.</p>

<p>Let's have an example searching for <em>Who's Who? - SIZE020 - Klack (Mix Two)</em></p>

<p>Searching from their site leads to <a href=""https://musicbrainz.org/search?query=Who%27s%20Who%3F%20-%20SIZE020%20-%20Klack%20%28Mix%20Two%29&amp;type=recording"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>, with an almost correct first result (probably because the 100% correct infos are not on the database at all).</p>

<p>Using the API leads to different situations which are causing some issues.
I made some different attempts with no success, even if I think I know enough of <em>Lucene</em>'s syntax to write a successful query for this service.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording?query=%22Who%27s%20Who?%20-%20SIZE020%20-%20Klack%20%28Mix%20Two%29%22"" rel=""nofollow"">Take 1</a> - empty results with the query <em>""Who's Who? - SIZE020 - Klack (Mix Two)""</em></li>
<li><a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording?query=Who%27s%20Who%3F%20-%20SIZE020%20-%20Klack%20%28Mix%20Two%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Take 2</a> - completely wrong results with the query <em>Who's+Who%3F+-+SIZE020+-+Klack+(Mix+Two)</em> (same result with the unescaped <em>?</em> character)</li>
<li><a href=""http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/recording?query=%22Who%27s%22%20AND%20%22Who?%22%20AND%20%22SIZE020%22%20AND%20%22Klack%22%20AND%20%22Mix%22%20AND%20%22Two%22"" rel=""nofollow"">Take 3</a> - empty results with the query <em>""Who's"" AND ""Who?"" AND ""SIZE020"" AND ""Klack"" AND ""Mix"" AND ""Two""</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I know that <em>SIZE020</em> shouldn't be in the query, but I don't want to deal with file names on client side so I'm just pushing the query to their service hoping that everything will work. And it works, but only if I query the service through their website, making me think that my query syntax is wrong and leaving me clueless.</p>

<p>Do you have any hint on why I get different results between website and xml API?</p>

<p>EDIT: as a side question, given a random file name, what's the better way to submit the query? I'm getting good result using the web version and submitting the typical mp3 filenames (like <em>artist_-_title_(version).mp3</em> but I'm not getting anything good from my client.</p>
