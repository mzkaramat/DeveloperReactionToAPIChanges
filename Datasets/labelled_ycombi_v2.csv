(And more Social Image Formats soon!)<p>Here’s how it works:<p>1) Choose a preset design from our library.<p>2) Customize your template with default values for colors, text, photos &#x2F; logos.<p>3) Integrate the meta tags into your project.<p>4) Change parameters of the Image URL in the meta tag to dynamically fill elements of the template. You can f.ex. generate your blog article’s title on to the image or fill a browser window with a screenshot of a website.<p>We started building Placid as a tool to automate Social Image Generation for our own projects and we figured it’s something that other people could use too. For now, we concentrated on providing Meta Images, but we’re already testing Placid for other use cases, like generated Pinterest Images. So we’ll soon add:<p>* An editor to create templates from scratch (and with custom Image Dimensions)<p>* More options to customize Presets<p>* More Presets (also for Instagram Posts and Stories, Pinterest Pins, Facebook Posts,..)<p>We’d love your feedback and suggestions for missing features or preset options :)<p>Armin",Twitter,hello hacker-news <p> ’ armin co-mak placid deliv social imag servic placid let gener nice share imag twitter facebook api social imag format soon <p> ’ work <p> 1 choos preset design librari <p> 2 custom templat default valu color text photo #x2f logo <p> 3 integr meta tag project <p> 4 chang paramet imag url meta tag dynam fill element templat f ex gener blog articl ’ titl imag fill browser window screenshot websit <p> start build placid tool autom social imag gener project figur ’ someth peopl could use concentr provid meta imag ’ alreadi test placid use case like gener pinterest imag ’ soon add <p> editor creat templat scratch custom imag dimens <p> option custom preset <p> preset also instagram post stori pinterest pin facebook post <p> ’ love feedback suggest miss featur preset option :) <p> armin,0.05,0.5599999999999999

2018-07-03 01:29:50,"There are two closely intertwined but separate issues: centralization and governance.<p>Current web technology typically sees one entity controlling the data; if you sign up for a website, your data goes in their database.  That&#x27;s due to the common stack we all build on: some form of API&#x2F;web server, some form of SQL&#x2F;NoSQL database, some form of client.  If we had a world where developers could simply and freely implement services on top of a <i>different</i> paradigm, we&#x27;d stop having to worry about big central entities like Facebook, Google, your local computer store, whoever -- being able to sell your data.  They simply wouldn&#x27;t have it.  I&#x27;m not sure what that paradigm is, but IPFS, Secure Scuttlebutt, Solid, the Dat Project etc. are all interesting takes on what a solution to that problem might look like.<p>At the other end of the spectrum is governance, which is something sorely lacking, and allows these misinformation campaigns to spread so freely.  Do we still have to worry about governance in a world where we own our own data?  Yes, probably, if the surge of illegal and genuinely nasty content like Child Pornography on the new big distributed networks (eg. ZeroNet) is any indicator.  Censorship is a spectrum, and while I can appreciate sticking to the view that free speech is best for all, there are some behaviours which society has mostly agreed are objectionable.<p>The current paradigm of each social service provider essentially being a self-determining fiefdom isn&#x27;t too dissimilar to how humaity&#x27;s always done things, I guess (for instance, different pubs&#x2F;bars will have differing clienteles and degrees of socially acceptable behaviour), except for the scale -- which unfortunately probably does merit a change in how our current major sites are run (YouTube and Twitter in particular seem like they&#x27;ve been gamed incredibly well by cynical parties).  I don&#x27;t know how we solve this problem, but better technical underpinnings might make this a simpler problem to solve.  Independently, however, I note that there are places like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.coop</a> where they&#x27;re trying to take that problem on head-first.<p>It will be interesting to see what the next few years of the internet look like.  My hope is that we see some of the people interested in this problem start focussing on normal people instead of other techies; suggesting to my friends that they move to Secure Scuttlebutt is pretty hard, as the majority of them really only use their phones (or tablets).<p>Personally, I think something that tied together messaging and an event invitation&#x2F;calendaring system would take a <i>massive</i> knock out of the people who are only hanging onto Facebook for those two things, but that&#x27;s still a techy view of &quot;kill centralisation&quot; and not a social view of &quot;how does that new platform get governed?&quot;.",Twitter,"two close intertwin separ issu central govern <p> current web technolog typic see one entiti control data sign websit data goe databas #x27 due common stack build form api #x2f web server form sql #x2f nosql databas form client world develop could simpli freeli implement servic top <i> differ </i> paradigm #x27 ;d stop worri big central entiti like facebook googl local comput store whoever abl sell data simpli #x27 #x27 sure paradigm ipf secur scuttlebutt solid dat project etc interest take solut problem might look like <p> end spectrum govern someth sore lack allow misinform campaign spread freeli still worri govern world data ye probabl surg illeg genuin nasti content like child pornographi new big distribut network eg zeronet indic censorship spectrum appreci stick view free speech best behaviour societi mostli agre objection <p> current paradigm social servic provid essenti self-determin fiefdom #x27 dissimilar humaiti #x27 alway done thing guess instanc differ pub #x2f bar differ clientel degre social accept behaviour except scale unfortun probabl merit chang current major site run youtub twitter particular seem like #x27 game incred well cynic parti #x27 know solv problem better technic underpin might make simpler problem solv independ howev note place like <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;social.coop"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f social coop </a> #x27 tri take problem head-first <p> interest see next year internet look like hope see peopl interest problem start focuss normal peopl instead techi suggest friend move secur scuttlebutt pretti hard major realli use phone tablet <p> person think someth tie togeth messag event invit #x2f calendar system would take <i> massiv </i> knock peopl hang onto facebook two thing #x27 still techi view quot kill centralis quot social view quot new platform get govern quot",0.09072622779519329,0.34360849878091254

2018-05-03 06:14:09,"&gt; I&#x27;m aware of that–that&#x27;s why I said it is possible that you can do it from JavaScript. What I&#x27;m saying is that the JavaScript layer generally causes issues like this, because UINavigationController only works in specific cases. For example, scrolling only works if you&#x27;re a singular top-level scroll view. Getting the titles to animate only works if you don&#x27;t try to modify it after the fact. Putting a button in the navigation bar&#x27;s title view just makes it mess up when it runs its first layout pass. A lot of frameworks end up doing this, or making it very easy for this to occur, so you end up with &quot;broken&quot; navigation of the likes seen in that GIF. Of course, it&#x27;s not unusable, so those who aren&#x27;t as familiar with how it should work don&#x27;t notice the difference.<p>Most of those issues that you bring up with UINavigationController are, while annoying, not actually _that_ common in apps, and people run into them at the native level too - it&#x27;s not entirely a JS issue. Provided you&#x27;re not doing anything too against the grain (which the Wix API more or less protects novice users from doing), you&#x27;re unlikely to experience too many issues and it functions as an almost completely indistinguishable UINavigationController experience for pretty much everyone.<p>As an aside, if React Native would fix TouchableOpacity to follow platform convention, most people would have difficulty detecting RN apps.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m surprised you haven&#x27;t drawn the cynical conclusion from this: that I&#x27;m desperately trying to keep my skills relevant in a world where they&#x27;re being increasingly obsoleted...<p>I didn&#x27;t draw that conclusion, you&#x27;re correct - but had it been the case, I really wouldn&#x27;t have blamed you. I prefer writing [UI|App]Kit day to day and I&#x27;d hate to not be able to. I&#x27;m more than capable in... just about any programming ecosystem, but they&#x27;re simply not as enjoyable for reasons that are tough to put into words.<p>&gt;Wait, are you really telling me to stop &quot;putting down&quot; non-native projects?<p>No, not at all. I put down Qt all the time myself, but then again, how do you define native? ;)<p>My point here is that coming into these threads and saying that people should be building native iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;etc is a bit of a rough sell, given how nuanced actually developing at the native level for those platforms is (e.g, most people wouldn&#x27;t know that a UITableView section header is really a grouped row in NSTableView - AppKit is woefully undocumented and cobweb filled in 2018). Apple needs to get their shit together, and maybe that&#x27;s what Marzipan or whatever is - in fact, I really hope it is.<p>Until then, there&#x27;s simply no compelling reason to build native [UI|App]Kit when the writing is on the walls. Instead of fighting this battle, people need to complain (loudly, very loudly) to Apple. Electron &amp; co are not taking over because they&#x27;re inherently better as an approach, but because native platforms are literally just rolling over.<p>&gt;it&#x27;s developers who need to realize that the user is important<p>This is idealism, and I applaud you for it, but it&#x27;s honestly misplaced (and I wish it wasn&#x27;t). The user is only important _when you actually have users_. For most apps these days, time to market and getting it out the door trumps whatever perceived native benefits there are.<p>I personally build for quality in my projects because it&#x27;s what I want representing me, and that&#x27;s sadly about the only justifiable reason these days.<p>&gt;Sorry, I&#x27;m not on Twitter, so I&#x27;m not aware of what you&#x27;re talking about here. Could you provide more context?<p>Was a bunch of hubbub recently over this article (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inessential.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;youre_practically_a_mac_developer"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inessential.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;youre_practically_a_mac_de...</a>), where it boiled down to Xcode&#x2F;Apple-ecosystem developers decrying alternative approaches (Electron, RN, etc), and more or less saying that it should be easy to just reuse the same stuff for a Mac app. The argument that most non-Xcode&#x2F;Apple-ecosystem devs made was that Apple:<p>- Really, really sucks when it comes to Mac&#x2F;AppKit documentation these days, and discoverability in comparison to the likes of JS and such is nowhere near the same.<p>- Live reload &gt; compile and run, Swift playgrounds aren&#x27;t a solution.<p>- [Almost any JS unit testing framework] &gt; Unit testing in Xcode<p>The tl;dr = Apple is getting off relatively easily for not keeping their dev environments competitive, and people complaining about Electron &amp; co making inroads should really be complaining at Apple for neglecting this stuff. I tend to agree, as noted earlier... and, hell, it&#x27;s not even limited to the above points.<p>For example:<p>- Why the hell are the Apple forums not scrapped and dumped into a hosted StackExchange? It&#x27;s 2018.<p>- Why the hell is Radar still a black hole of information? There are better ways to do this nowadays.<p>- Why the hell is so much of Cocoa &amp; AppKit completely un-Google-able? Half the time you try to find something, you wind up in an archived email thread from the early 2000s. There is no way a new developer is going to put up with this crap in 2018. Shit, if it wasn&#x27;t for NSHipster transcribing WWDC videos we&#x27;d still be sitting there watching video content just to understand a programming ecosystem.<p>- Why the hell does every Cocoa&#x2F;AppKit dev put all their stuff on Twitter these days? They&#x27;re just as responsible as Apple at this point. The JS community documents the everloving bajeezus out of their projects, whereas the only mention you&#x27;d find about, say, NSCollectionView frame&#x2F;bounds change notifications is on Twitter.

2018-04-27 11:06:23,"From the Guardian, which can&#x27;t be accused of being a Trump lover:<p>&gt; This system of indoctrination and propaganda complicates any official announcement of the Trump meeting. An ideological framework must be devised to explain the talks with the enemy; and regardless of how they are presented, there is an uncomfortable margin for the “infallible” leader to be seen to fail in his aims.<p>&gt; Trump is a volatile opponent who telegraphed his impatience even before the two men fixed a place to talk, warning he would walk away if he thought the preparations weren’t going anywhere.<p>&gt; But this unpredictability is the reason there are talks at all. Trump’s barrage of verbal and Twitter attacks on North Koreans – which have been reported there – led Pyongyang to question if it was, for the first time in a generation, facing a US president willing to attack them, experts say.<p>&gt; Officials there have long calculated that no US president would risk lives in Seoul with an attack on the North. But under Trump that is no longer a safe assumption, says Andrei Lankov, professor of Korean Studies at Kookmin University.<p>&gt; Kim, like his predecessors, has proved adept at manipulating regional and world powers into providing aid and political support while offering little in return.

2018-02-20 19:06:58,"I am not a coder by any means, but I am a heavy social media user and know a lot about politics, sociology, psych, organizing, health, comms---and I admit, until I read this thread, I liked this article because it gave me a better reason for all the screw ups, beyond, &quot;The Executives are dithering and have no business skills and social skills.&quot; Or the theory &quot;The Executives do nothing because they don&#x27;t care if women and vulnerable people die.&quot; Which is far more disturbing....it can&#x27;t be true, even if it <i>feels</i> true.
I would give anything if they&#x27;d listen to users who have been around awhile. So few people worked there and also used it at the same time. (And users longingly miss the Fail Whale logo...)
As a user (250,000+ tweets) under a pseudonym, twitter has incredible uses, things Facebook and other platforms didn&#x27;t do, because they were so closed and hard to search. They created echo Chambers, because you could only see people you already knew or were slightly connected too. Or worse, your mom or mother-in-law could find you. Twitter was so open--if I want to discuss philosophy or Japanese food or an MRI result, 24&#x2F;7 I just search and people who love that are there. And pseudonyms had to exist, because thousands of people in real life have the same name. (just like the rest of the Internet back then and yes, now too) They thought people would just post status updates like, hey eating lunch, but we did way way more. They made it 140 chars with 20 chars reserved for names because many people had expensive tiny data plans, but could update by text message; allowing a much wider demographic to use it, and across multiple countries, even low tech ones with limited access. 
The most critical piece tho is that users invented everything good about twitter (Sorry creators--but we did). TW allowed some html symbols, so a user put an @ in front of a user name to reply, and it worked! Users also invented hashtags, the first one was for organizing BarCamp--which was kind of a conference not about alcohol and the original manual RT, and MT for modified tweet, and commenting on top of  someone&#x27;s tweet, or at the end of it and we figured out how to shrink long urls to post links. bit.ly had no purpose til then, and many users became Developers and got full access to the API and we crowdsourced hundreds of changes and ideas, from pictures to videos to emoji to gifs to analytics, to accessible apps for people with vision, hearing, speech issues. All while making lots and lots of jokes.
They didn&#x27;t start out with a heavy respect for pseudonyms, and privacy, and free speech--but TW learned it fast after the Green Iran Revolution, and after many patient users wanted to keep privacy because they had rare diseases, and mental health issues, and parents of kids with autism and speech issues took to it and found each other and felt less alone. It was less complicated than blogging and writing long stories on laptops after events happened. I could do everything from live tweeting a doctor&#x27;s appt to an ER visit and get reactions from friends who could tell me what to ask. 
We still tweet everything from recipes to exact instructions on how to ride a bike, how to organize groups like #occupy to crowd sourcing Flu symptoms and rashes, to who is watching what TV show and how cool it is to watch live sports &quot;together&quot; even for people who can&#x27;t leave the house that night and meet.
Weekly hour long Chats take place under special hashtags like #hcsm for Health Care Social Media or #meded for medical education. (doctors and science fans and academics found twitter and they debate articles, techniques, crowdsource diagnoses)
Police and emergency responders and good Samaritans have used it to (swear to god, it&#x27;s true) befriend people who sound troubled or suicidal and validate their pain and sadness and find them help.
It is to this day, the only platform I know that allows people from many different areas to find like-minded people and to bring together people across multiple subject areas.
Nothing else does it quite the same way.

On the surface it appeared that Paperless was a copy of Mayan EDMS concepts and implementations without giving credit or mention.

2017-10-08 18:57:24,"A lot of people seem to be re-discovering and re-inventing this approach, due to the recent discussions in the React community about the use of &quot;render props&quot; as an alternative to Higher-Order Components.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that this is actually how React-Redux worked originally [0], but it was changed to be a HOC later.<p>There&#x27;s other recent examples at [1] and [2].  Dan Abramov&#x27;s tweet at [3] describes why React-Redux changed from a render prop to a HOC in the first place, and there&#x27;s another good Twitter discussion thread at [4] (where Michael Jackson points out that this is suddenly a really popular thing to try).<p>Glancing at the source code for this implementation, I&#x27;m actually rather concerned about its performance.  It looks like it calls `connect()` _inside_ of a functional component.  That means that every time React re-renders the parent functional component, `connect()` will generate a new HOC component, React will see that it&#x27;s a different component type being rendered (because the new HOC is not the same as the old HOC), and the entire child component tree will be thrown away by the reconciliation process.  This does not seem like a very performant approach.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;react-redux&#x2F;tree&#x2F;11adf721fbb3f5548c6e5f6b4999835d41807850#deprecated-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;react-redux&#x2F;tree&#x2F;11adf721fbb3f554...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jsonnull&#x2F;redux-render"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jsonnull&#x2F;redux-render</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@gott&#x2F;connecting-react-component-to-redux-store-with-render-callback-53fd044bb42b"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@gott&#x2F;connecting-react-component-to-redux...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;913712295594926080"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;913712295594926080</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mjackson&#x2F;status&#x2F;915335846324092930"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mjackson&#x2F;status&#x2F;915335846324092930</a>",Twitter,"lot peopl seem re-discov re-inv approach due recent discuss react commun use quot render prop quot altern higher-ord compon #x27 interest note actual react-redux work origin 0 chang hoc later <p> #x27 recent exampl 1 2 dan abramov #x27 tweet 3 describ react-redux chang render prop hoc first place #x27 anoth good twitter discuss thread 4 michael jackson point suddenli realli popular thing tri <p> glanc sourc code implement #x27 actual rather concern perform look like call connect _inside_ function compon mean everi time react re-rend parent function compon connect gener new hoc compon react see #x27 differ compon type render new hoc old hoc entir child compon tree thrown away reconcili process seem like perform approach <p> 0 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;reactjs&#x2f;react-redux&#x2f;tree&#x2f;11adf721fbb3f5548c6e5f6b4999835d41807850#deprecated-api"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f github com #x2f reactj #x2f react-redux #x2f tree #x2f 11 adf 721 fbb 3 f554 </a> <p> 1 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;jsonnull&#x2f;redux-render"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f github com #x2f jsonnul #x2f redux-rend </a> <p> 2 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;medium.com&#x2f;@gott&#x2f;connecting-react-component-to-redux-store-with-render-callback-53fd044bb42b"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f medium com #x2f @gott #x2f connecting-react-component-to-redux </a> <p> 3 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;twitter.com&#x2f;dan_abramov&#x2f;status&#x2f;913712295594926080"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f twitter com #x2f ;d an_abramov #x2f statu #x2f 913712295594926080 </a> <p> 4 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;twitter.com&#x2f;mjackson&#x2f;status&#x2f;915335846324092930"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f twitter com #x2f mjackson #x2f statu #x2f 915335846324092930 </a>",0.11424825174825172,0.36191724941724945

That’s why building an API was such a key early change of what Facebook was.<p>Typically, Twitter does something similar to Facebook on the surface (a news feed) but is not planning on serving as an authentication layer, so they do a lot less to address grievers, inauthentic accounts and lately, unwanted political influence.<p>The News Feed was the first key feature, built internally and it boosted the business model that Facebook has started leveraging: targeted advertising.

Because management had to place ad-focused people high up, they took over a bit of the attention, but leaders at both companies know to focus on the end-goal.<p>I can easily imagine Facebook making more money from transaction fee, or distributing 3D-content; I can imagine Google making more money similarly (typically, CPA is kind of that).

2017-06-10 18:03:55,"Note: I&#x27;m the one in the video, an original engineer on Titus, and now the product&#x2F;hiring manager of the Titus team at Netflix. Also, I do not actively monitor hacker news, so it is unlikely that I&#x27;ll follow-on to this conversation (@aspyker on Twitter is an easier way to reach me).<p>Is Titus Open Source Yet? No.<p>Why?<p>Reason #1: When we created Titus, we married the back end of a container execution engine (Titan) with the front end of a scheduling system for stream processing (Mantis). We have a goal at the time to stabilize existing usage at Netflix. We didn&#x27;t have a goal of removing all code from both sides that wasn&#x27;t needed after the marriage. We wanted to clean this up before releasing in open source as we would have to spend more time telling people what to ignore in the codebase that is no longer used in Titus. We also didn&#x27;t have time to create proper interfaces that separate Titus from other important operational systems at Netflix. We have recently been re-implementing the engine to have clean interfaces with minimal code.<p>Reason #2: When Titus was created it had a user API that grew during initial usage in batch applications. Given the number of clients using this API, it was hard to change it without impacting users. Compounding this, we added service application support without thinking much about making the API well designed. We have recently been working on a new API that was designed to handle both use cases. This API is currently being adjusted based on internal feedback.<p>Reason #3: The space of container management platforms is truly a crowded space. There are many other great options out there. When we eventually open source Titus, we hope it is clear why Titus is unique in this space specifically for &quot;all-in&quot; Amazon EC2 customers, for NetflixOSS cloud platform adopters (those who use Spinnaker, Eureka, etc.), and supporting the level of complexity we do (VPC IP per container, GPU&#x27;s, complex fleet and capacity management, etc.). Finally, showing how at scale production battle hardened Titus is. We realize even with these differences, we&#x27;ll spend a consider amount of time justifying these points to those who look at the space more generally. We would prefer to not spend any time &quot;marketing&quot; our differences.<p>Reason #4: Our main focus at Netflix is to service Netflix developers providing the easiest to use and most reliable service. Open source is something that is valuable to us with regards to potential external contributions as well hiring and retention of the best engineering talent in the world. This value, while significant, isn&#x27;t as important as providing our internal Netflix value. As a part time responsibility I help open source at Netflix. Therefore, I am also aware that doing open source well (like NetflixOSS Spinnaker as a shining example) requires more investment for teams than posting the code to github. Our team is small today and we do not believe we can make Titus open source as great as we&#x27;d want it to be. That said, we&#x27;re growing (did I mention I&#x27;m the hiring manager - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.netflix.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;862432"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.netflix.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;862432</a>) every day and can see the value of changing this equation.<p>I am truly honored that someone would great a whole website to ask for Titus. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.istitusopensourceyet.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.istitusopensourceyet.com&#x2F;</a> made me laugh last night and decide to write this response today.

2017-06-05 10:52:12,"As a &quot;user&quot;, I love logging in with social media. How awesome is it that I can just click a button and be logged in instantly? No worrying about setting up a password, at least, for most websites. I used to not trust it, but after becoming a developer and learning: it is just grabbing an email or a name is not too bad. Though sometimes, it may grab more than that, such as your friends list, etc. Somehow, that became okay and no one cares.<p>As a &quot;developer&quot;, things are quite different. There are a few libraries of code on Github and you can find examples across the Internet. For the most part, these examples do work after you have set up some API backend on the social media platforms themselves.<p>Code would almost seem straightforward. However, it is not always the case, especially, when a social media platform is ever-changing.  For example, last week, someone released a new product on Hacker News and went about his way, only to realize, that people were attempting to login to Facebook, which recently upgraded from SDK 4 to SDK 5. Massive changes occurred. How embarrassing to go live, only for one of your social media buttons not to work? It&#x27;s not his fault, but it&#x27;s Facebook who updated their code so older versions no longer work. Most developers are trying to focus on their own code and make sure it works. Now they have to worry about potential users being unable to access the front door?<p>When I went to update Facebook SDK 4 to SDK 5 on one of my own platforms, using Facebook&#x27;s very example that they provided. I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I ended up removing Facebook from my registration and login screen. The three that remained were Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn.<p>After some careful testing with these three, they work for the most part, except occasionally, if someone logs into Google, and then tries to login again real fast, such as your code not remembering them and keeping them logged in, Google&#x27;s token expires and it won&#x27;t auto-generate a new one, and it creates a problem, an error that you can&#x27;t even catch, so your users are exposed to seeing that error.<p>Twitter, too, seems to have some issues. Using the examples you can easily find on the Internet, and I&#x27;m no genius when it comes to this stuff, but I managed to copy some code, put it together, and make it work with my database, this would also come with problems: It keeps looping and acquiring a new oauth token without ever going back to my website with the information.  After spending nearly an hour trying to figure out what the problem was and scouring the Internet with very few answers, I gave up. So Twitter has now been removed.<p>LinkedIn is my last resort, but to offer only one option: is it better at all?<p>The purpose of social media logins was to making logging in easier, but none of these social media platforms have beginner or even novice developers in mind. If any of the code was to change while your web application is live, than you are screwed, trying to come up with a patch for it. Lest, you might not even find out until someone actually reports it that your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google login isn&#x27;t working. How would you know otherwise, since you probably might only use one or none?<p>I sought to find out: Do we really need to use social media logins? In this day and age, it is supposedly expected. For the most part, researching claims, there is a 60% usage of social media login buttons. But are they necessary? I came across another article from a developer at MailChimp which makes a great point about social logins: while people use them, if people like your application or find it useful, they are going to register and login with a username or email address, regardless of whether you have social media or not.<p>Here is the article: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2F;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2F;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-...</a><p>Navigating to MailChimp&#x27;s registration and login page: there is no social media presence.<p>So I know there are some attempts at making life easier for developers out there, such as Hybridauth Social Login PHP Library ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hybridauth.github.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hybridauth.github.io&#x2F;</a> ), which may do a good job, but I&#x27;ve not used it yet.  There are also other non-free solutions out there in which you pay for a script or a web company to handle it all for you. This too, might be good, but why? Why isn&#x27;t it easier for developers to set up social media buttons?<p>Maybe it is security concerns or whatever, but you would think that as large as these social media platforms are, they&#x27;d be better at giving you the email and username or whatever you need.. and making it easier. After all, it is technically free branding for them that you put on your website.<p>Anyone else struggle with social media login or just give up completely or maybe you found a really easy solution that grants you peace of mind?",Twitter,"quot user quot love log social media awesom click button log instantli worri set password least websit use trust becom develop learn grab email name bad though sometim may grab friend list etc somehow becam okay one care <p> quot ;d evelop quot thing quit differ librari code github find exampl across internet part exampl work set api backend social media platform <p> code would almost seem straightforward howev alway case especi social media platform ever-chang exampl last week someon releas new product hacker news went way realiz peopl attempt login facebook recent upgrad sdk 4 sdk 5 massiv chang occur embarrass go live one social media button work #x27 fault #x27 facebook updat code older version longer work develop tri focu code make sure work worri potenti user unabl access front door <p> went updat facebook sdk 4 sdk 5 one platform use facebook #x27 exampl provid #x27 get work end remov facebook registr login screen three remain googl twitter linkedin <p> care test three work part except occasion someon log googl tri login real fast code rememb keep log googl #x27 token expir #x27 auto-gener new one creat problem error #x27 even catch user expos see error <p> twitter seem issu use exampl easili find internet #x27 geniu come stuff manag copi code put togeth make work databas would also come problem keep loop acquir new oauth token without ever go back websit inform spend nearli hour tri figur problem scour internet answer gave twitter remov <p> linkedin last resort offer one option better <p> purpos social media login make log easier none social media platform beginn even novic develop mind code chang web applic live screw tri come patch lest might even find someon actual report facebook twitter linkedin googl login #x27 work would know otherwis sinc probabl might use one none <p> sought find realli need use social media login day age supposedli expect part research claim 60 usag social media login button necessari came across anoth articl develop mailchimp make great point social login peopl use peopl like applic find use go regist login usernam email address regardless whether social media <p> articl <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2f;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it&#x2f;"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f blog mailchimp com #x2f social-login-buttons-arent-worth </a> <p> navig mailchimp #x27 registr login page social media presenc <p> know attempt make life easier develop hybridauth social login php librari <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;hybridauth.github.io&#x2f;"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f hybridauth github io #x2f </a> may good job #x27 use yet also non-fre solut pay script web compani handl might good #x27 easier develop set social media button <p> mayb secur concern whatev would think larg social media platform #x27 ;d better give email usernam whatev need make easier technic free brand put websit <p> anyon els struggl social media login give complet mayb found realli easi solut grant peac mind",0.157012432012432,0.3143809893809893
2017-05-27 09:03:52,"Seeing slides in BIOS-UEFI-Security.6-Mitigations.pdf that imply that there&#x27;s critical crypto being done in SMM mode makes me feel unfathomable hopelessness. The whole x86_64 platform security model (which includes all the privilege levels and the corresponding access control mechanisms) is one hell of an overgrown clusterfuck that could not be <i>more</i> hostile to formal verification.<p>There&#x27;s lots of wantonly convoluted stuff going on -- a random example is the access control mechanism for the PCH&#x27;s GPIOs (search &quot;GPIO registers lockdown&quot;, in quotes). This isn&#x27;t, of course, implemented with a register which contains bitfields determining which privilege level can write to which sets of registers. That would be too simple. The GPIO Lockdown-Enable bit <i>can</i> [sic] be changed by the same software that the lockdown mechanism is meant to deny access to! This seems like utter pointlessness -- what use is an access control mechanism if the agent being restricted can change the parameters of the mechanism willy-nilly -- but Intel has a solution! Changing the lockdown-enable bit triggers an SMI and shunts control to SMM mode, which is, naturally, expected to include code that figures out that this bit should not be disabled, and is to flip it back on (and return from the interrupt, having trashed the caches a bit).<p>This is, of course, a pathologically needless level of complexity -- in the ARM world, we have registers with silly names like &quot;NSACR&quot; that higher-privileged execution modes can set to restrict access to certain resources. There&#x27;s certainly no BIOS-OEM-provided code that needs to exist and be correct in order to implement such a basic task. In the end, this level of access-control is equivalent to a bloody Boolean operation or two, for heaven&#x27;s sake! All the CPU needs to do is to decode the instruction, realise it&#x27;s a potentially-privileged instruction, decode what the instruction tries to modify, look up in a table which register holds the relevant permissions bitfield, and do the relevant boolean operation between that register&#x27;s contents and an appropriate bitmask, and fault depending on the result. Since there&#x27;s an extremely close match between the properties that needs to hold (the truth table of all combinations of &quot;privilege level <i>x</i> can modify resource <i>y</i> iff bit <i>n</i> in register <i>z</i> is set&quot;) and the mechanism that enforces it, it&#x27;s easy to reason about this scheme and not difficult to either prove an implementation correct (or find counterexamples).<p>Meanwhile, the &quot;wake up SMM and hope it&#x27;ll countermands the illegal write&quot; scheme depends on a lot more machinery. How does it work on a multi-core&#x2F;multi-socket platform? How does this mechanism interact with the caches or the memory model? Is it possible to set up a race condition where the illegal write ends up going through uncountermanded because SMM mode can be made to not see the register in an illegal state? This is orders of magnitude of orders of magnitude more complex than analysing a lookup-table and a bitmask -- we need to understand the semantics of memory reads&#x2F;writes, of caching, of mode switches to SMM and the SMI interrupt, and how all of this clusterfuck is affected by the fact that there&#x27;s <i>multiple cores</i> in our system. LANGSEC people will call this a &quot;shotgun parser&quot; -- when input data checking &#x2F; recognition is interspersed with processing logic.<p>Even if all of this miraculously works and there&#x27;s literally no way that all the cores working together can send an illegal write that SMM code won&#x27;t countermand -- there&#x27;s still the issue of making sure that the specific SMM blob that our BIOS OEM wrote cooperates properly with this. Indeed, making BIOS OEMs implement these sorts of convoluted and critical mechanisms and expecting them to get all of them perfectly right requires a level of optimism that doesn&#x27;t yet exist. The situation has devolved to the point that there is literally a tool called &quot;chipsec&quot; that lets you test for the presence of a handful of well-known security-critical things (from time to time someone discovers a new one, of course, UEFI&#x2F;ACPI and the x86_64 privilege model is too complex for people to be sure that we found all the issues) that UEFI programmers are <i>notorious</i> for messing up. That this tool needs to exist is shameful. Of course, the security of the x86_64 platform doesn&#x27;t just depend on a bunch of magic access control registers being set right, there&#x27;s Turing-complete code that needs to be implemented by the BIOS OEM (and runs in the most privileged execution mode that isn&#x27;t Intel&#x27;s &quot;management processor&quot;) that is <i>security-critical</i>, and, well, it&#x27;s hard to prove that arbitrary Turing-complete code behaves correctly.<p>The auxiliary CPU mode (SMM) initially meant to hide APM and emulate PS&#x2F;2 mice in 90s-era computers is now <i>critical</i> to platform security, and does dangerous stuff like crypto and handling pointers from UEFI &#x2F; the OS. Every few months someone I follow on Twitter finds some new way to trick some widely-deployed SMM code into writing to a memory region it shouldn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s quite depressing. Great. Another pointless defender&#x2F;attacker arms race that the defenders could decisively win had Intel thrown away the spitefully complex intricacies of SMM and the x86 security model and replaced it with a clean, formal-verification-friendly set of privilege levels whose correct operation doesn&#x27;t depend on platform firmware code.

2017-04-06 17:36:30,"Twitter also did something that I find particularly interesting: they somehow convinced developers that you needed them to bless your app and provide APIs to build a client that accesses their service, even though those credentials must be distributed <i>to the public with your client</i>. To people like me who are old enough to have dealt with AOL, the idea that developers are willing to buy into this fiction is absolutely insane: if the official Twitter client can do it, then so can your client, and there is nothing Twitter can do to stop you that doesn&#x27;t also break their client (which they are generally <i>less</i> willing to do than change their API on short notice!).<p>As far as I can tell the only thing that enforces this is what should amount to an antitrust level of collusion between the mega-companies to restrict access to products (via services such as the Apple App Store) that do things that the other mega-companies dislike, as it is in all of their best interests to maintain this same fiction. The reality is that client-side API keys are totally meaningless and make no sense: in an attempt to believe they make sense some developers then start to believe other crazy things like &quot;if I compile a token into my program other people can&#x27;t read it as it is compiled&quot; or to insist &quot;there must be some way to encrypt my binary to make sure that other people can&#x27;t get my API key&quot;, but this kind of broken thought only happens due to a broken premise :&#x2F;.<p>(That said, it isn&#x27;t 100% clear to me that if someone released a true Twitter client Apple would remove it, so if someone disagrees with that premise I am all ears: that is simply the only theoretical mechanism I can see that would seem to enforce this, and I feel like I have heard of this happening before, but AFAIK the random apps in the App Store for abusing Tindr are all based on reverse engineering the true API for the service, but it is also possible that Apple cares less about helping Tindr or that Tindr has a different internal mentality and culture surrounding this kind of thing; or it could even be the case that these now have been removed and I haven&#x27;t noticed yet as I don&#x27;t really pay much attention to track them, or even that I am wrong and they are somehow more indirect in their implementation.)",Twitter,twitter also someth find particularli interest somehow convinc develop need bless app provid api build client access servic even though credenti must distribut <i> public client </i> peopl like old enough dealt aol idea develop will buy fiction absolut insan offici twitter client client noth twitter stop #x27 also break client gener <i> less </i> will chang api short notic <p> far tell thing enforc amount antitrust level collus mega-compani restrict access product servic appl app store thing mega-compani dislik best interest maintain fiction realiti client-sid api key total meaningless make sens attempt believ make sens develop start believ crazi thing like quot compil token program peopl #x27 read compil quot insist quot must way encrypt binari make sure peopl #x27 get api key quot kind broken thought happen due broken premis #x2f <p> said #x27 100 clear someon releas true twitter client appl would remov someon disagre premis ear simpli theoret mechan see would seem enforc feel like heard happen afaik random app app store abus tindr base revers engin true api servic also possibl appl care less help tindr tindr differ intern mental cultur surround kind thing could even case remov #x27 notic yet #x27 realli pay much attent track even wrong somehow indirect implement,0.009294871794871788,0.5614316239316239

Obviously not a graceful change but I feel there should not be that as many people working there as there are now.<p>2. Focus on engagement, not growth. Twitter may not be growing in the way that the market wants, but the users that it does have are incredibly devoted to the platform. If I were to leave Twitter there&#x27;s nowhere else I could go. If I leave Tinder or Snapchat there are many other platforms that can fill almost the same niche. Twitter needs to capitalize on that.<p>3. Make brands pay to have a page. In other words, if you&#x27;re not an individual, you must pay to create an account. Savvy companies have realized that being on Twitter is a key part of a solid social media campaign. To not be on Twitter is to miss out on a huge opportunity to reach a very devoted audience, and you can&#x27;t reach that audience anywhere else (#2). Some brands are already doing this well (e.g. Wendy&#x27;s.) If the choice comes to paying for the opportunity to market on Twitter, and not market at all, companies will gladly pay. On the plus side, this could let Twitter reduce the interstitial ads on the timeline.<p>Everyone hates ads, but the way that brands have engaged with individuals on Twitter really humanizes them and makes people form more real relationships with them. It also forces brands to be more accountable and aware.<p>4. Bring back Vine. A huge part of Twitter&#x27;s staying power is the unique culture it has created (#2). Staying power is what gives Twitter its greatest value to advertisers (#3).<p>5. Ramp up engagement on Periscope. Periscope being a part of Twitter makes a lot of sense because Twitter is all about stuff happening live. It&#x27;s a great platform but I think it also needs a desktop client (with OBS support, the way Twitch does) to allow the caliber of content creation to go up.<p>6. Re-open APIs. Twitter has sown a bad seed with the dev community by making its API very restricted. Tweets make up a very interesting dataset on which other people could build very unique things on top of. Twitter should encourage this, not stifle it. &quot;Look what cool things we can do with Twitter&quot; will only serve to strengthen the image of Twitter as a unique, irreplaceable platform.<p>---<p>These are the main issues I see as an everyday user of Twitter.

2017-02-27 20:09:27,"&gt; Anecdotally, there is a ton of money left on the table by established businesses...<p>True. 
fwiw, I worked on the same project at Twitter 4 years back - the Facebook folks call it capacity planning at scale, we called it capacity utilization modeling. The goal was the same - there are all these &quot;jobs&quot; - 10s of 1000s of programs running on distributed clusters, hogging CPU, memory and disk. Can we look at a snapshot in time of the jobs usage, and then predict&#x2F;forecast what the next quarter jobs usage would be ?
If you get these forecasts right ( within reasonable error bounds ), the folks making purchasing decisions ( how many machines to lease for the next quarter for the datacenters) can save a bundle.<p>From an engineering pov, every job would need to log it&#x27;s p95 and p99 CPU usage, memory stats, disk stats...Since Twitter was running some 50k programs back then (2013ish) on these Mesos clusters, the underlying C++ API had hooks to obtain CPU and memory stats, even though the actual programs running were all coded up in Scala (mostly), or python&#x2F;Ruby (bigger minority), or C&#x2F;Java&#x2F;R&#x2F;perl ( smaller minority ). There&#x27;s an interesting Quora discussion on why Mesos was in C++ while rest of Twitter is Scalaland...mostly because you can&#x27;t do these sort of CPU&#x2F;memory&#x2F;disk profiling in the jvmland as well as you can in C++.<p>OK, so you now have all these CPU stats. What do you do with them ? Before you get to that, you have the usual engineering hassles - how often should you obtain the CPU stats ? Where would you store them ?<p>So at Twitter we got these stats every minute ( serious overkill :) and stored them in a monstrous JSON ( horrible idea given 50000 programs * number of minutes in day * all the different stats you were storing :))<p>So every day I&#x27;d get a gigantic 20gb JSON from infra, then I&#x27;d have to do the modeling.<p>In those days, you couldn&#x27;t find a single Scala JSON parser that would load up that gigantic JSON without choking. We tried them all. Finally we settled on GSON - Google&#x27;s JSON parser written in Java, that handled these gigantic jsons with no hiccups.<p>Before you get to the math, you would have to parse the JSON and build a data structure that would store these (x,t) tuples in memory. You had 50k programs, so each program would get a model, each model originated from a shitton of (x,t) tuples, the t being minutely and the fact that some of these programs had been running for years, meant you had very large datasets.<p>The math was relatively straightforward...I used so called &quot;LAD&quot; - least absolute deviation from mean, as opposed to simple OLS, because least squares wasn&#x27;t quite predictive for that use case. Building the LAD modeling thing in Scala was somewhat interesting...Most of the work was done by the commons math Apache libraries, I mostly had to ensure the edge cases wouldn&#x27;t throw you off, because LAD admits multiple solutions to the same dataset - it&#x27;s not like OLS where you give it a dataset and it finds a unique best fit line. Here you&#x27;d have many lines sitting in an array, depending on how long you let the Simplex solver run. 
Then came the problem of visualizing these 50,000 piecewise line models using javascript heh heh. The front end guys had a ball with the models I spit out.<p>If someone&#x27;s doing this from scratch these days, NNs would be your best bet.

2017-02-22 15:59:49,"Last couple of years or so have been an eye opener for me on how I choose libraries, tools and services for my project. One important lesson was that never choose a service which don&#x27;t have plug and play open source alternative. Even hyped start ups go out of business and big companies like Facebook and Google shut down services.<p>Third party APIs are a even bigger risk. Facebook and Twitter APIs used to change quite often 2-3 years ago. (Haven&#x27;t personally worked on this off late though.) APIs and services which seem too cheap are generally the ones which should be avoided. Because it is more likely that the companies running these will not find a sustainable business model.<p>Even Open Source projects get abandoned quite often. Sometimes a team puts together an impressive open source project and then they get acquired by a big company which results in abandonment of the project. I have one client who has his startup riding on Kurento Media Server for WebRTC calls. This product is in development from last one and half years. Now, after Kurento&#x27;s acquisition by Twilio, Kurento&#x27;s future is not clear. Also it&#x27;s not a project which any body can just get into and start developing it further. Thankfully Kurento is not abandoned yet by the development team, but I had read somewhere that they are looking for new maintainers.<p>The lesson learned is only depend on mature open source projects and depend on PaaS services which make those open source projects available as easy to use services. Even if that PaaS service go down, there is a high chance that you will find someone who can deploy and support it for you.<p>However, if you are depending on a third party API or a relatively unknown Open Source Project for critical functionality, treat it as a big risk in your product&#x27;s future road map and be prepared with a contingency plan.<p>Right now in cloud services there are way too many products which are not easily replaceable. But these are easy to use and sometimes solve really difficult problems. So the temptation to use them is too high. So they still end up in the stack, especially when the clients themselves push for these services to be used.",Twitter,last coupl year eye open choos librari tool servic project one import lesson never choos servic #x27 plug play open sourc altern even hype start up go busi big compani like facebook googl shut servic <p> third parti api even bigger risk facebook twitter api use chang quit often 2 3 year ago #x27 person work late though api servic seem cheap gener one avoid like compani run find sustain busi model <p> even open sourc project get abandon quit often sometim team put togeth impress open sourc project get acquir big compani result abandon project one client startup ride kurento media server webrtc call product develop last one half year kurento #x27 acquisit twilio kurento #x27 futur clear also #x27 project bodi get start develop thank kurento abandon yet develop team read somewher look new maintain <p> lesson learn depend matur open sourc project depend paa servic make open sourc project avail easi use servic even paa servic go high chanc find someon deploy support <p> howev depend third parti api rel unknown open sourc project critic function treat big risk product #x27 futur road map prepar conting plan <p> right cloud servic way mani product easili replac easi use sometim solv realli difficult problem temptat use high still end stack especi client push servic use,0.007016450216450218,0.3981437229437229

Twitters message counts is high for a public IM system, but it&#x27;s not that high overall messaging volume for private&#x2F;internal message flows. More importantly, despite the issue of large follower counts, if breaking large accounts into trees of reflectors, it decomposes neatly, and federating large message flows like this is a well understood problem:<p>I&#x27;ve half-jokingly in the past you could replace a lot of Twitters core transmission of tweets with mail servers and off the shelf mailing-list reflectors, and some code to create mailboxes for accounts an reflectors to break up large follower lists (no, it wouldn&#x27;t be efficient, but the point is distributing message transfers including reflecting messages to large lists is a well understood problem), and based on the mail volumes I&#x27;ve handled with off the shelf servers I&#x27;ll confidently say that 100&#x27;s of millions of messages a day that way is not all that hard to handle with relatively modest server counts.<p>Fast delivery of tweets using reflectors to extreme accounts would be the one thing that could drive the server number up high, but on the other hand, there are also plenty of far more efficient ways of handling it (e.g. extensive caching + pulling rather than pushing for the most extreme accounts)<p>Note, I&#x27;m not saying Twitter doesn&#x27;t have a legitimate need or the servers they use - their web app does a lot of expensive history&#x2F;timeline generation on top of the core message exchange for example.

2016-10-26 16:51:53,"Depends on what APIs you need, and what your tolerance is for futzing around with things.  If you need the larger API surface of the .NET Framework and you don&#x27;t have time to be on the bleeding edge, go with Mono.  Xamarin Studio has good support for it, and even if you&#x27;re using some other editor (VSCode, Spacemacs, etc.) everything still generally works with the tooling for Mono.<p>There are basically two components that need polishing for .NET Core to be a reasonable choice - the implementation of NetStandard 2.0 for .NET Core (so you get all the old APIs back), and for the tooling to mature (transition from project.json back to fsproj).  These efforts are coming along nicely [1][2], but still aren&#x27;t ready for prime time.<p>Here&#x27;s a roadmap that Enrico Sada has laid out to get the F# .NET Core situation to maturity: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;enricosada&#x2F;6f0a0424ca65b9d08e5a84f79560c4c6"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;enricosada&#x2F;6f0a0424ca65b9d08e5a84f79...</a><p>And by the way, don&#x27;t worry too much about switching over from Mono to .NET Core.  With NetStandard 2.0 the API changes should be minimal.

It has been used to port dozens of open and closed-source games to the Pandora and other mobile platforms. It was also used for the Android real-Minecraft launcher (called Boardwalk I think).<p>Current goals include testing&#x2F;improving the remote rendering (which allows software like emulators to easily serialize and remotely render OpenGL), increasing compatibility (testing games + filing&#x2F;fixing issues on GitHub), adding WINE support (will be a trial&#x2F;error process of running WINE, debugging&#x2F;fixing the thing that prevents initialization, repeat), and writing more feature tests (which are actually pretty easy. You write a simple program to make OpenGL calls and assert which OpenGL ES calls should be emitted from the other end).<p>- - -<p>patchkit - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lunixbochs&#x2F;patchkit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lunixbochs&#x2F;patchkit</a><p>Skills: Python, C, ASM<p>This project allows you to reproducibly patch compiled binaries with one or more short Python scripts.

It mainly needs glue code written for more architectures, support for PE&#x2F;MachO formats, and improvements to the C compiler&#x2F;linker.

As a result, the project is mostly a joke right now (just a pretty UI around Vim that breaks most interactive Vim plugins).<p>I do think NeoVim is mature enough to take this the rest of the way into being a serious project, and there&#x27;s a fair bit of interest.

I honestly don&#x27;t know.<p><i>We hope you’ll consider the fact that as Twitter has become a dominant platform of communication, verified users with huge follower bases influence the public dialog as much as elected officials, and should be accountable for their public statements on Twitter just as they are for public statements they make anywhere else.</i><p>I find it hard to believe that people agree with a Developer Agreement and Policy such as Twitter&#x27;s.

2016-07-09 06:04:43,"I switched to Pinboard few months ago when Delicious committed seppuku and made their site completely unusable. First, Delicious just shut down their site for something like a week, then they resurrected some ancient version of their site that looks &amp; behaves like it&#x27;s from 2007. Then they switched to an old domain (del.icio.us) and broke every bookmarklet and plugin that used their API. (I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re planning on selling delicious.com domain name, which is worth a lot of money, so they made the switch.)<p>But the worst part is that you can&#x27;t even save a link with all these changes they’ve made!

2016-06-04 02:45:46,"Hey.  I think I&#x27;m in a pretty good position to give you some feedback.  As background, I maintain a well-received list of high-quality React and Redux tutorials and articles [0], and a catalog of Redux-related libraries, addons, and utilities [1].  I also spend a lot of time hanging out in the Reactiflux chat channels, and apparently currently have the messages posted in Reactiflux since the service moved to Discord [2].  Finally, I wrote the official Redux FAQ page from scratch [3].  So, while I&#x27;m not a public name in the React community like Dan Abramov, I&#x27;m pretty in tune with what&#x27;s going on in the ecosystem.<p>The first thing to consider is that the size of the target market for any &quot;addon&quot;, &quot;mod&quot;, or &quot;extension&quot; for any technology is, by definition, limited to the size of the user base for the original technology.  While Redux is certainly popular, and basically the winner of the &quot;Flux Wars&quot;, you&#x27;re limited to a subset of the JS dev community.<p>A second factor is idiomatic usage.  Any framework ecosystem is going to have an idiomatic way of doing things.  Tutorials will teach those same idioms, training classes will teach those idioms, people will write apps using those idioms, and the vast majority of the userbase is going to share those idioms.  When you start going outside those idioms, fewer people will understand your approach, and fewer people will be interested in something that&#x27;s not &quot;the normal way&quot;.<p>Redux is fairly minimal, so similar to Backbone, there _is_ a fairly active ecosystem with people adding numerous different spins in usage, and additional layers on top, like yours.  However, only a few of those have gained particular traction (like redux-saga).  Idiomatic Redux tends towards explicit and functional, rather than implicit and object-oriented.<p>Third, there are a number of overlapping approaches and implementations being developed by different people, as you can see by browsing my addons catalog.  Two dozen libraries implementing &quot;local&#x2F;component state&quot; in various ways, a dozen more for &quot;subscribe to changes in a slice of state&quot;, and I don&#x27;t know HOW many approaches to handling &quot;side effects&quot;.  Not sure how much of that is people not knowing what else is out there, how much is &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; syndrome, and how much is people just trying to scratch an itch.  So, any one addon in a given category is somewhat competing for mindshare, and only a few will really get attention.<p>Fourth, honestly, a lot of it really is actually getting the attention of the &quot;thought leaders and influencers&quot;.  I signed up for Twitter just so I could actually reply to some of the conversations I saw going on, and when Dan saw that, he tweeted out that I&#x27;d just joined.  Five minutes later I had 30 followers, and 100 by the end of the day.  Small potates as Twitter goes, obviously, but the point is that people followed me just because Dan said I was interesting.  (I&#x27;m not, really :) )  The &quot;Doing Whatever Dan Abramov Tells Me To Do&quot; fake book cover has a bit of truth to it [4].  Now, I&#x27;m not saying go harass Dan, or Ryan Florence, or Christopher Chedeau, but when core members of the React&#x2F;Redux community point at stuff, other people look.  And, that said, Dan does tweet out anything that looks vaguely interesting, so tweeting him a link is a valid approach.<p>So, Radical.  I _do_ actually have Radical listed in my addons catalog, but I have it listed on the &quot;Variations&quot; page [5], which is where I list libraries that are distinctly deviating from the idiomatic Redux approach (and, as you&#x27;ll note, there&#x27;s quite a few of those).  Looking at it, there&#x27;s good points and bad points.<p>Good:<p>- &quot;Reducing boilerplate&quot; is certainly a viable selling point.  One of Redux&#x27;s core principles is that things are explicit rather than implicit, but obviously many people dislike much of the verbosity.  So, that&#x27;s a good focus.<p>- Radical has documentation.  Like, _real_ documentation.  An actual description that tries to give a motivation and explanation, some meaningful code samples, and API docs.  The average JS lib on Github has a short repo one-liner, maybe a couple paragraphs in the README, and a five-line code snippet with very little explanation for where it fits in.  This is decidedly a good thing.<p>Mixed:<p>- Focus on grouping actions and reducers.  Again, there&#x27;s numerous opinions and ideas, and putting those together _is_ one semi-popular approach (per the &quot;Ducks&quot; concept), so it&#x27;s not unheard of.  On the other hand, Dan encourages arbitrary reducers responding to arbitrary actions to prevent coupling, and that&#x27;s considered the idiomatic approach.<p>- Use of Typescript in the lib and the samples.  There are certainly Typescript users in the Redux community, but ES6 is the common approach.<p>Bad:<p>- Use of an OOP approach to managing things.  I know it&#x27;s still dispatching actions and such and updating its own slice of the store, but the Redux community is heavily influenced by Functional Programming, and as such an OOP approach is less likely to gain interest.<p>- The fact that you do need to hook the generated reducer into the store isn&#x27;t as clearly called out as I&#x27;d like to see.<p>- Lack of a full-blown example written using Radical.  Again, the fact that you have actual code samples is good, but if this is such a big improvement, a &quot;real&quot; app example would go a long way to show that.<p>- Both the docs and the source are in single files.  Both might be easier to read through if they were split into smaller pieces.<p>- There&#x27;s a number of libraries that look like they do something fairly similar.  The list at [6] has many that are more component-oriented, but there&#x27;s some overlap.  The list at [5] also has some similar options.<p>Overall, it looks like a well-written library, with a valid use case, but the fact that it&#x27;s a non-idiomatic approach means there won&#x27;t be as much interest, and therefore fewer users _and_ fewer people willing to pass it along.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I hang out in the Reactiflux chat channels [7] evenings EST if you&#x27;d like to drop in and talk about it.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;react-redux-links""

2016-05-30 13:27:07,"I really enjoy TDD when I get into the rhythm, but I&#x27;ve found that setting up the infrastructure can be a real barrier, especially for a language&#x2F;framework that I&#x27;ve never worked in.<p>However, I have written code without it and I frequently find that when I do so, I very quickly regret it. Either I get confused about what precisely I&#x27;m doing or I end up having to write tests after-the-fact and it is much harder. The barrier is worth overcoming. How?<p>1) Find good tutorials and <i>work</i> through them.<p>A lot of people say that the best way to learn something is just to dive in and build something. I disagree, at least when that thing is new to you. I find it is much better to find a tutorial that guides you through building something the first time. It is worth asking around on twitter or on a relevant subreddit for this. Then, don&#x27;t just read--actually work through at least a good chunk of it. Once you&#x27;ve done that you have some code you can look back on when you are looking for the basics of how to set up your tests.<p>2) Don&#x27;t worry about mocking as much in the beginning.<p>The purpose of mocking is to avoid having the test take a long time to run due to the machine spending a bunch of time working on other things. Given that you are waiting on the machine when you run your test, this is actually meaningful. So, mocking intelligently can be a win if you it saves you that time. However, it also has the downsides that it can take a lot longer to write the test and it can make your test more brittle. For that reason I find it often makes sense not to mock and just write a bunch of tests that do in fact (for example) hit the database. This is especially a good idea with a new language where trying to use 7 new libraries at once (<i>cough</i> javascript <i>cough cough</i>) is going to lead to confusion.<p>Also note that TDD doesn&#x27;t really work if the code is already written because doing fine-grained tests for code that is already written is really hard. It is better to do interface&#x2F;API tests and put off unit testing until you are willing to refactor the code.<p>Note also that there are some tasks where your tests are going to be more like infrastructure tests and your changes won&#x27;t be quite as granular as TDD doctrine dictates. That is something you have to accept when everything is coming together, because that is the realm of integration tests.<p>There is a tutorial I&#x27;ve written which aims to teach this alongside teaching configuration management, though it is my first tutorial.

2016-04-29 21:40:43,"No, people &#x27;should&#x27; (according to this view) be emailing Google and asking them to release their client webapp as free software, after which they can continue using all the AJAX they want.  If by some miracle they agreed, it would give users a number of advantages including:<p>- Making customization (Greasemonkey etc.) easier by removing the need for customization tools to muddle through JS minification&#x2F;obfuscation.  While in practice various tools today are doing a good job customizing Gmail anyway, I imagine they could make more changes and more invasive changes with access to the source.<p>- Special case: making client-side encryption browser extensions safe.  Right now they are fundamentally unsafe (if they hook into the webapp rather than providing a separate interface), because there is nothing stopping Google from quietly adding some JS code to grab and report the plaintext before it gets encrypted.  <i>By itself</i>, releasing the webapp&#x27;s source wouldn&#x27;t fix this because you would still have to trust Google&#x27;s servers to send the same JS to everyone - but a browser extension could be enhanced to hash the page JS and refuse to operate with non-approved hashes, combined with a process where someone outside of Google manually approves changes as they are released, providing at least cursory review.  Nobody wants to review obfuscated code.<p>- Allowing users to detect and remove any other forms of tracking&#x2F;deanonymization that might be present such as mouse cursor or keystroke recording, canvas fingerprinting, etc., more reliably than with the sorts of purely technical measures that could be implemented in a browser (since these things are hard to block without preventing the app from doing its job).<p>- The kicker: Allowing the same webapp to be used with a different backend, so if you don&#x27;t want Google to have access to your email, or don&#x27;t trust them not to cripple functionality in the future, or need a lot of storage and can get it cheaper elsewhere, or are in China and have an (intentionally) shitty censored connection to the international internet, ... the list goes on... then you can self-host it, without losing the familiar interface.  You can also host your own clone service for others to use, perhaps forking off the original code when Google makes an unpopular change, as they are wont to do.  Of course this requires someone to actually do the technical work of writing a suitable new backend for the client to talk to, and in the case of a fork to maintain a huge codebase (compare Palemoon and such), but without free software you can&#x27;t even get started (legally).<p>Of course, Google might not be too happy about that last point.  But rms&#x27;s ideology has never been pragmatic about &#x27;business needs&#x27; and such.  It&#x27;s concerned only for the users.<p>Twitter is a somewhat less traditional case: the case for free software is either less applicable or far more, depending on how strictly you define &quot;free software&quot;.  This is because unlike Gmail, which provides decent support for third party clients, Twitter has long cracked down on them in various arbitrary ways and enforced strict rules that prevent them from innovating on UI.  Since one of the informally-defined &#x27;freedoms&#x27; of free software is the ability to modify it, it should be possible to morph the official browser client into anything you want - even if that means keeping just the API access layer and building an entirely new UI on top - and continue to use it freely.  Thus if Twitter changed their tune and actually dedicated themselves to these freedoms, that would imply starting to tolerate access by arbitrary client software, and users would hugely benefit.  However, if for some reason Twitter were to hypothetically release their client under a free license - even under the GPL - while otherwise continuing with their current policies, it wouldn&#x27;t affect the situation much.  The license would at least allow third parties to check the source for Twitter&#x27;s own API key and copy it into their own apps without exposing themselves to legal liability related to copyright&#x2F;DMCA.

2016-02-10 22:16:22,"I know there are theoretical alternatives to Twitter, but until the appropriate userbase is out there then they&#x27;re not truly viable alternatives. I know that&#x27;s a Catch-22, or a paradox, or whatever you want to call it, but that&#x27;s the sad reality for those of us that would like to leave the platform. So, in lieu of leaving, here are the features I feel like would help Twitter retain me as a user:<p>1. Bring back custom apps! Twitter is a <i>service</i>, and I want control over how I access that service. This would also take such a huge burden off of Twitter: don&#x27;t care about the super bowl? Use an app that lets you filter hashtags, piece of cake! So many features can be implemented on top of a service, with no extra effort from Twitter. I get that this could  conceivably enable filtering timeline ads, but seriously they can just pull API keys for apps that do that, it&#x27;s a non-issue.<p>2. Let me subscribe to ideas, not just people. If I <i>do</i> care about the super bowl, maybe let me turn on push notifications for tweets about it from people within my network for whom I otherwise do not have push notifications enabled.<p>3. Make chronological timelines a setting. Not an option, not a tab, a semi-permanently enabled <i>setting</i>. It&#x27;s the most annoying thing about Facebook right now, having to explicitly re-enable chronological timelines every week or so when Facebook has &quot;forgotten&quot;. As it stands, even that much is an improvement over Twitter&#x27;s proposed always-on non-chronological timeline.<p>4. Don&#x27;t nanny me unless I ask you to. There have been reports that Twitter has blocked notifications for @replied tweets because Twitter suspected the tweet would be offensive. I get that harassment is an issue and that Twitter was trying to be proactive, but make it an option. The user in this case was failing to be notified of tweets they <i>wanted</i> to see, and had no way to disable the &quot;feature&quot;.<p>5. Inconsistency foments distrust. If you want that blue check mark to mean something then you&#x27;d best lay out a solid and strict process for them. I&#x27;ve seen at least one person have theirs removed over unsubstantiated claims, yet more egregious offenders have kept theirs throughout. I&#x27;ve seen others go through the process for acquire their blue checks and they always seem to have different requirements. Some reported having to change their profile name to their real name, others said they had to put their actual photo on their profile.",Twitter,"know theoret altern twitter appropri userbas #x27 truli viabl altern know #x27 catch 22, paradox whatev want call #x27 sad realiti us would like leav platform lieu leav featur feel like would help twitter retain user <p> 1 bring back custom app twitter <i> servic </i> want control access servic would also take huge burden twitter #x27 care super bowl use app let filter hashtag piec cake mani featur implement top servic extra effort twitter get could conceiv enabl filter timelin ad serious pull api key app #x27 non-issu <p> 2 let subscrib idea peopl <i> </i> care super bowl mayb let turn push notif tweet peopl within network otherwis push notif enabl <p> 3 make chronolog timelin set option tab semi-perman enabl <i> set </i> #x27 annoy thing facebook right explicitli re-en chronolog timelin everi week facebook quot forgotten quot stand even much improv twitter #x27 propos always-on non-chronolog timelin <p> 4 #x27 nanni unless ask report twitter block notif @repli tweet twitter suspect tweet would offens get harass issu twitter tri proactiv make option user case fail notifi tweet <i> want </i> see way disabl quot featur quot <p> 5 inconsist foment distrust want blue check mark mean someth #x27 ;d best lay solid strict process #x27 seen least one person remov unsubstanti claim yet egregi offend kept throughout #x27 seen other go process acquir blue check alway seem differ requir report chang profil name real name other said put actual photo profil",0.04802489177489177,0.42605519480519477

2016-01-06 05:04:00,"This entire thing may be confusing to a lot of people, as many are already confused by what the entire Android court case was about. The confusion is not accidental. Google&#x27;s very extensive PR machine has put in <i>a lot</i> of resources to make sure people are confused (what Oracle puts into lawyers, Google puts into PR). But just to lay down a few facts:<p>Since 2006&#x2F;7, Java has been available under two licenses: commercial and open-source. The commercial license allows free implementation of the Java APIs and has a full patent grant, but requires conformance with the Java TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) <i>and</i> requires payment if used in mobile devices (this was Java&#x27;s main revenue stream for a long time). It is also possible to license the JDK source from Oracle under the commercial license for a fee. The same JDK is also released under the GPL. This license is completely free and unencumbered (the GPL itself prohibits any restrictions). It does not require compatibility (unless you want to call the result &quot;Java&quot;), and has no field of use restrictions. It also has a full (implicit) patent grant. As this article notes, OpenJDK&#x27;s copyleft is not viral either (certainly not more than Linux): applications and libraries running on top of it are unaffected due to the &quot;classpath exception&quot;. You can do <i>whatever you like</i> with Java when you use it under the terms of its open-source license: use the implementation, use just the APIs and implement it yourself, use the whole thing or just small portion, pass the TCK, not pass the TCK, fork it or not. You are even allowed to use it to implement .NET.<p>Google has had both of these options for licensing Java (at least since May 2007, but that was still before Android was released). Until very recently, Google chose neither. They couldn&#x27;t reach an agreement with Sun on the fee for the first license, and didn&#x27;t like the second (possibly because they feared that phone manufacturers would reject a GPL runtime, classpath exception or no). Instead, they chose to argue in court that the APIs are not Oracle&#x27;s to license[1].<p>What has changed now? Perhaps Google realized that given Android&#x27;s success, phone vendors would swallow whatever license Google gives them. In any event this is a win for everyone: Google wins because they will need to spend less resources on maintaining Android, Oracle wins because Java will now be on Android, and Android and Java developers win because they&#x27;ll have a better runtime and greater compatibility. This is contingent, however, on Google not forking OpenJDK too much beyond compatibility; the license does allow them to do so.<p>Yes, the mainline OpenJDK project is steered by the JCP (Google, Intel, Twitter, and IBM are all members) and Oracle does have veto power, but that is just the project governance. Anyone is free to fork OpenJDK, as long as they don&#x27;t call the result Java (unless they fork and choose to pass the TCK). The situation is no different from other large open-source projects.<p>[1]: I have no opinion on whether or not Google&#x27;s actions were legally justified (I do have an opinion about their ethics), but I do know that unlike  Google&#x27;s PR line, the ruling has little or no effect on the industry. Google&#x27;s actions with Java&#x27;s APIs were quite different from any other API implementation that I know of. Also, the ruling does not apply to web APIs.

2015-11-28 01:52:41,"I&#x27;ve been more and more concerned about Telegram recently. Here&#x27;s a mail I sent them recently covering most of these concerns. Naturally, I got no response.<p>&quot;
Hey there Telegram!<p>I have been an early Telegram user since late 2013 and was highly optimistic that it would become a perfect messenger.
It&#x27;s quite perfect from a UX point of view – which is important to gain users – but other things aren&#x27;t that perfect.<p>You claim to be open and secure, but taking a closer look that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true. Your API is open and the client apps were released as open source, but your server-side code remains closed source. It&#x27;s been 2 years now and you still haven&#x27;t open sourced the server. Do you still plan to release it? You say that you will eventually add paid options, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be compatible to open-sourcing the server.<p>Of course one would have to trust you that you actually use that version of the server on your side, which leads to the second issue that concerns me. You advertise being secure a lot, but default chats don&#x27;t use end-to-end encryption and secure chats aren&#x27;t even possible for group chats. Even for encrypted chats a bunch of concerns were raised by much respected people in the security community, I&#x27;m sure you are aware of that and will not brag about that here.<p>I opened an issue on the Android app&#x27;s issue tracker in early 2014 about end-to-end encryption (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;9SfYt"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;9SfYt</a>). There have been dozens of comments on that issue, discussing how it could be implemented but there was no official reply by the Android maintainer or any official Telegram account, despite numerous attempts.<p>The Android app&#x27;s maintainer also doesn&#x27;t seem to understand version control &#x2F; git and commits tons of changes in a single commit and also doesn&#x27;t use tags for versioning. He also doesn&#x27;t merge pull requests but rather includes them in his large commits (thus also removing all attribution). There are also binary blobs in the source code and there are various licensing issues. All these issues have been raised but the Android maintainer doesn&#x27;t seem to care about it.<p>The issue tracker for that app has now been closed by the maintainer and there was no explanation for this. Several people tried several times to reach out to the maintainer, but he never replied. I believe this is a huge problem for a security app, and for open source apps in general.<p>Last but not least, the current version of Telegram on the Google Play Store (3.2.4) is not open source.<p>Of course, client apps don&#x27;t have anything to do with the server implementation, API, or general issues about Telegram. You&#x27;ve linked a Trello board somewhere deep on your website, but the link is broken. It&#x27;s a major issue that there is no way to discuss problems, feature requests, or ask questions to the developers (we don&#x27;t even know who the developers are). There is a community-run Telegram support account and a press contact and there&#x27;s this email address and a Twitter account. Obviously none of these work as a discussion &#x2F; issue platform, and you don&#x27;t seem to reply to Telegram questions or Twitter.<p>A very good way to fix this is creating an organization account on GitHub and create a repo where you can use the issue tracker and wiki. You could also move the &quot;official&quot; clients to that account to have them at one place and you could use it to open-source or document other things related to Telegram.<p>It&#x27;s also not clear at all who runs Telegram. All your website says is that it&#x27;s financially supported by Pavel Durov and technically supported by Nikolai Durov. Your official apps and AS Networks are registered by &quot; Telegram Messenger LLP&quot; or &quot;Telegram LLP&quot; and your website claims your headquarters are based in Berlin, although no such company seems to be registered in the EU. You are legally required to publish your address and contact information to comply with German law §5 TMG. Additionally, both the LLP&#x27;s and Nikolai&#x27;s address are apparently at (different) British P.O. boxes.
Is Nikolai the only developer or are there more? How are the official maintainers related to the LLP? Are they paid? Are they employees? Are there any employees at all? Who runs the company?<p>I&#x27;m really trying to not hate you and hope that you are what you claim to be, but it seems like you advertise security and openness successfully, so that the average user and the press buys it, but taking a closer look you seem rather shady without being very open. I feel very sad about this and hope you&#x27;ll improve that.<p>Please shed some light and address these issues, most importantly a public issue tracker &#x2F; discussion forum.<p>Thank you!

you also now have paying options for people with more intensive needs, either timing wise (down to one run per day, and one run per 4 hours will be a possibility once i&#x27;m confident 1: we can handle it, 2: it can actually provide value in the real world) or number-of-tlds-wise.<p>notifications! yeap i know it&#x27;s basic, but we now send you a mail when a run is complete, so you don&#x27;t have to bother reloading waiting for that progress bar to reach 100%. a few client asked us about sms notification, but i&#x27;m not sure about multiple notification channels yet.<p>so what&#x27;s next :<p>we have a bunch of stuff that stayed on the backburner while i was working on making the production as autonomous as possible (complete CI&#x2F;CD stack, built with chef, openstack heat, jenkins, the whole shebang) and the other dev was working on ironing the kinks
existing when interacting with horrible protocols like whois (for the sake of everyone&#x27;s sanity, i really hope rdap (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.rdap.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.rdap.org&#x2F;</a>) gets traction) or misbehaving dns, or just plain old bugs. we&#x27;re now bringing them back on the front of the workbench.<p>parking detection.<p>this one is simple, and everybody will get it, but i noticed a large number of parked domains in resolution runs, so they&#x27;ll be marked as such.<p>automated phishing detection.<p>this has been a major demand so i&#x27;m prototyping a CV system (ab)using ghost.py and opencv to see if i can get something that has a reasonable false positive rate.<p>malware detection.<p>a smaller demand because it&#x27;s already well covered by other products. for the moment paying accounts get access to google safebrowsing, and i have a bunch of threat exchange APIs access ready to enter the quorum. there&#x27;s a lot of datasharing between those, so i don&#x27;t want to generate false positives because of data sharing. i have also been working slowly on PR for cuckoo sandbox that&#x27;ll help me launch fleets of sandboxes in various configuration (hopefully i&#x27;ll have enough variants that the client is able to more or less choose the one that correspond to its production environment to try and catch targeted attacks)<p>keyword prediction based on the root domain.<p>we have a keyword generator that can generate domain variants, think &#x27;cheap-brand&#x27; for &#x27;brand&#x27;, but if you&#x27;re like me you probably can&#x27;t think of a lot of those (i had good success asking marketing guys for ideas). once again AI to the rescue, i&#x27;m tracking which keywords had the most &#x27;success&#x27; in finding resolving variants, which means once i&#x27;m able to establish lexical domains i&#x27;ll be able to offer everyone a &#x27;most likely keyword for this domain&#x27; help to feed the generator.<p>an API!<p>at the very beginning, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and the iphone 5s the cool product of the year, squatmon was just a very large and very ugly python script i used in various recon engagements. as we decided to slap a shiny web interface on it and share it with others, we didn&#x27;t take the time to make an API the first class citizen and the web interface just the reference client implementation.

But I was around here when that happened, which was not that much time ago so I find it weird that you guys don&#x27;t remember.<p>Twitter pulled some very dirty stuff on Meerkat, merely days before launching Periscope and later, in order to favour their own Meerkat clone. That&#x27;s when everything changed from &#x27;it&#x27;s a free market&#x27; to &#x27;it&#x27;s our market and we can kick you out for no reason&#x27;. And yeah, it actually is Twitter&#x27;s market, they are allowed to do anything they like with it and &quot;monopoly regulations&quot; aside, they can kick you out of their for no reason.<p>But let me tell you what I don&#x27;t find ethical about all of this. That when you are going to develop for them, they do not tell you straight away: we are going to fuck you up if what you do turns out to be valuable; quite the contrary, they just put out their &quot;we-are-so-cool-and-we-love-developers&quot; face and invited everyone to be part of their platform blah blah blah.<p>That started around 5-6 years ago, and probably you (selectively) won&#x27;t remember this either, but back then the first killer apps that Twitter had were third-party Twitter clients that made the whole user experience better. They were a hit because back then, too, the main Twitter UX was a piece of s... and these alternatives were so much better. And guess what happened to those products? Twitter pulled the same shit on them, they bought TweetDeck which was arguably the one with the most users (or the one that needed the money the most), and banned all other clients from their API with a week-or-so notice. At that time, that thing was even worse, because I would even dare to say that Twitter somehow was in debt with those developers because a significant contribution to the growth of twitter was driven by people going through all these third-party clients, that&#x27;s plain treachery and there&#x27;s even a special circle in Hell for that thing.<p>Now history repeats again and will repeat forever because the message from Twitter in that sense is very clear: we don&#x27;t give a shit about our developers.<p>But now, it&#x27;s good to see that things are finally turning around. Twitter desperately needs a killer app right now, because they&#x27;ve lost the hype, they&#x27;re running out of money and investors don&#x27;t eat anymore that &quot;we will be profitable in ten years&quot; crap. The only one way that Twitter could be hip again is, oooooh the irony, if another great product starts driving people back into using Twitter, but guess what?

2015-06-19 19:58:20,"&gt; <i>It&#x27;s humorous that what you just said goes exactly opposite to the blog post, which talks about how docker is designed to do everything completely differently because current methods &quot;don&#x27;t scale&quot;.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s contradictory. We <i>do</i> want Docker to change, for the better, the way applications are built and run. And if you <i>do</i> want to throw away your existing stack and build your next application in the most portable and scalable way possible, then Docker can definitely help. It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> you to, because most people don&#x27;t upgrade everything at once: they improve their toolbox gradually.<p>For example, there is a meme that &quot;if you run more than one process in Docker, you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot;. I actually disagree with that. I think if you want to transpose an existing VM into a container, and think of it as a mini-server that you ssh into, that is your prerogative and Docker should support that use case. Maybe later you will look into the benefits of breaking up your application into smaller, single purpose containers (for example, you can now the Docker API and ecosystem at a finer level of granularity). And when you do, Docker should support that use case too.<p>A small disgression: I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that the tech community feels the need to coalesce around polarizing &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot; statements. I find it particularly unfortunate that <i>Docker</i>, a tool I created partly to make the development world <i>less</i> polarized, was chosen as a battleground for ideological battles that I find frankly boring... Everything doesn&#x27;t have to be a battle.<p>&gt; <i>Keep up the good work on docker though, it seems to be getting some good traction so far! I&#x27;m personally wondering if it&#x27;s more fashion based traction though, and someone will be inventing the next &quot;docker, but more buzzword&quot; before long.</i><p>Thanks.<p>Obviously it will be hard for me to answer that in an unbiased way. I think the &quot;fashion&quot; aspect is a matter of perspective. From the point of view of heavy Hacker News and Twitter users, there is a lot of hype, both positive and negative. But the huge majority of Docker users don&#x27;t hang out on Hacker News (if they even know what it is). They have a job to do, Docker helps them do that job, and they tell their friends and colleagues about it.<p>We&#x27;ve tried to invite as many real-world users of Docker at next week&#x27;s Dockercon, to talk about their experiences, both good and bad.

2015-05-23 15:26:36,"Let me address some issues on this thread on the best way I can because I am really tired of all the FUD and attacks. I will first address the stuff mentioned on that changelog about the FDroid build of fennec and then I will talk a bit about Mozilla, Eich and what I think people are doing wrong in here.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Tests [not sure about that]
  Removed: Crashreporter [tracking]
  Removed: Healthreporter (UI?)
  </code></pre>
All that stuff provides telemetry for Mozilla that helps in finding and addressing bugs. People complain about a website not working correctly on Firefox but disable all the reporting stuff and never fill a bug on bugzilla. That kind of thing is useful. The source code for that is available on github, you can check what is sent and decide if it is worth using it or not.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Mediastreaming (requires non-free library: play-services) [google&#x27;s binary blobs]
  </code></pre>
Users want stuff to work. I am not talking about users with a free software mindset that are willing to hop through unfortunate hops to get their system working. I am talking about the average non-technical non-aware-of-foss user which number in the millions world wide (billions?) They want their browser to be able to play multimedia content. If you don&#x27;t want to use non-free multimedia then don&#x27;t access mp3 and other patent encumbred content.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Updater [tracking]
  </code></pre>
Another piece that you can check the code. Everyone wants an evergreen browser that receives patches, keeps its health in check and is kept up to date. There is no way of updating software without sending some data about the current software. Check the code and see if there is any sensitive information being sent and decide for yourself.<p><pre><code>  Removed: EME&#x2F;DRM [adobe&#x27;s binary blob]
  </code></pre>
EME is one thing and DRM is another. They work together but they are not a single unity. Before EME&#x2F;DRM you had proprietary unauditable DRM software running wild on your computing device. Now you have an open source sandbox that can be audited to make sure that the proprietary DRM blob can&#x27;t escape and fetch personal fingerprint data from your computing device. If you don&#x27;t believe that the EME&#x2F;DRM sandbox included in your Firefox is the same as the one from the code, there are mechanisms for building your own and using it. And thats the important part: &quot;If you are against DRM then don&#x27;t using services that use DRM&quot;. Some people want to listen to music, watch movies and other multimedia on services that believe that DRM solves some stuff. EME&#x2F;DRM solution protects their personal data while giving them the features needed to use such services. If you don&#x27;t agree with DRM then you don&#x27;t use those services. The DRM blob is downloaded when you use those services, if you&#x27;re not using them then the blob is not on your machine and never will be.<p>The fight against DRM shouldn&#x27;t happen inside the browser but in the users mindset and towards the service providers. The EME&#x2F;DRM solution was created as a compromise, give the users what they want while trying the best solution to protect them. Let FSF and other FOSS entitites audit the EME&#x2F;DRM sandbox. Let researchers try to pick personal data and fingerprints from the machine. Match that against the other solution which is non auditable. If all the effort and action placed into the hate machine against EME&#x2F;DRM was instead directed at educating users and teaching about non-DRM services then EME&#x2F;DRM would not be needed.<p>And that brings us to the topic of action. Mozilla is the only large player in the browser ecosystem that has all its code open, its roadmaps published, its processess available for public perusal and collaboration. You can&#x27;t influence or be a part of Safari, Opera, IE, Edge and Chrome development. You can&#x27;t verify, audit, help steer, be a part of what the companies behind those products want for the the web.<p><pre><code>  THE WEB IS THE ONLY MASS COMMUNICATION MEDIA WHERE EVERYONE HAS A VOICE
  </code></pre>
Keeping the web free and open, made by everyone for everyone, is the mission of Mozilla. That mission passes through a lot of different efforts which you can help. Millions of people worldwide have no idea how to the web works and don&#x27;t know how to produce content and make their voice available online.<p>The Mozilla Webmaker project helps teaching the web through workshops. Instead of spreading FUD and attacking people online, you can direct your energy into positive actions such as educating users on how to make the web their own and how to make their opinion count such as when talking about the DRM situation. The webmaker initiative goes beyond that with workshops and activities to teach about privacy, online rights, net neutrality, information credibility, programming. All that is open and in need of help. Educating users do more about the web than removing EME&#x2F;DRM API hooks and sandbox.<p>Firefox is the only browser that has its source code completely open and where you can help steer the project. You can be a part of Mozilla and then join the thousands that are trying to steer the web towards the users. If you don&#x27;t agree with some practice, then, instead of shouting on Twitter and Hacker News, join the mailing lists and discussions. Be a part of the process. Help.<p>Firefox OS is the only mobile operating system developed in the open and based on web technologies that are not controlled by a single entity. You can help us create a wonderful mobile system that brings the benefits of the open web in the hands of everybody. Instead of rooting and fighting about isolated closed proprietary islands, you can help steer our little web boat. Our low-cost (and low-specs :-P ) devices are bringing internet access to lots of people in emerging countries, with that there is information sharing, education, and other life transforming opportunities that bring positive social change.<p>Mozilla is what we make it be. As volunteers, employees, fans and users we can make it more than it ever was. Mozilla is also a project, an idea, that making a good quality software and solutions as a foundation&#x2F;community we can rival companies and make the ideal of values over profit prevail on the web.<p>I see a lot of hate for all the decisions Mozilla makes. Apparently it is the fashionable trendy thing on the web to spread FUD instead of taking positive action and helping. The whole situation with Brendan Eich is one of those cases. Brendan is a normal human being like all of us. We all have our flaws, prejudices, qualities, dreams, and bad decisions. Everyone here has some opinion and action taken about such opinion that goes against something that is deeply important to some group. We&#x27;re humans, we make mistakes. We&#x27;re products of the zeitgeist of our formative years. We learn and change through time but yet we all make mistakes at the eyes of others and sometimes even to our own. Unlike many here, I&#x27;ve been around Brendan Eich couple times and he was always pleasant, supportive and energetic about the web. That is his passion and fight. A strong problem with the web is the echo chamber. Someone makes a mistake or something we all disagree and consider bad and that person is forever bound to suffer our hate. That kind of action leads us nowhere. Whats helps is education, empathy, showing &quot;the other&quot; why we thing our opinion is important and why we would think another course of action was correct. Dialog and comprehension makes the world a better place, pitchforks don&#x27;t.<p>You all here, may you be FUDing&#x2F;fear mongering or not, can help Mozilla, the Web, Brendan and everyone. You can join the cause of an open web though dialog and positive actions. You can help Mozilla better its code and actions. You can help teach people about the web and let them multiply their opportunities. You can help audit code, translate content, make us see the correct path when we&#x27;re in the dark. You can help Mozilla fight for a web made of people and not of incompatible features and companies.<p>Thats what I am asking. Instead of flamewars and fighting Mozilla, join us, help us work, teach and learn with us and we&#x27;ll all make a much better and interesting web.",Twitter,let address issu thread best way realli

It&#x27;s a shame that they couldn&#x27;t find a market for their product.<p>What&#x27;s a bigger shame is that they&#x27;ve both written articles disparaging Bitcoin technology now that they&#x27;ve decided to move on to other challenges.<p>We have a brand new data storage technology that allows for equal access read and write privileges on data that is permanent and shared equally across all nodes.

We won&#x27;t need centralized identity providers like Facebook. We can start to treat digital media as property and build up a viable economic system. We can actually account for people&#x27;s data use and the value of their contributions instead of this blind air gap between advertising and operation costs. We can create and transfer digital assets that represent all sorts of things.<p>Writers, photographers, musicians and anyone else who makes the content that fuels the advertising engines of Silicon Valley are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with how they publish work on the Internet. Putting something on a web page isn&#x27;t publishing. Posting something on Facebook or Twitter isn&#x27;t publishing. The act of publishing needs to be public and it needs to be permanent. Can you reliably quote from a blog or a tweet? No, you can&#x27;t, because the content could change. You can reliably quote from the second printing of a physical text because it would be almost impossible for someone to go through and change every copy.<p>All of this on a unified platform that isn&#x27;t controlled by anyone meaning there&#x27;s no danger of a private entity limiting access to APIs and destroying the hard work of developers, which Twitter has been doing for years.<p>I really hate to call them out because they&#x27;ve been very nice and incredibly helpful over the last year, but guys, come on, there&#x27;s no need to burn bridges.

2015-02-25 19:42:46,"Which is why I proposed that UI: it works automatically. While using the system, it simply indicates to you as you compose the message &quot;Yes, the email address you are sending mail to belongs to the person you intend to message&quot; or &quot;No, that email address belongs to someone else&quot; or &quot;This is a brand new email address.&quot; This way when you are emailing your lawyer to set up a will, or you email your accountant with your tax info, you can be sure that (a) you are emailing just the right person and (b) that only they can read the communication.<p>While setting up the system, you are simply required to link your identity. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, GMail, HN, the government all should allow you to easily link your identity. This should be a normal part of your account creation (this can tie in nicely with another change: getting rid of passwords and using a browser UI for identifying yourself a la Persona, but PGP based).  Basically when signing up for Twitter, it should optionally let you upload one of your public keys (via a nice browser UI no less). Twitter (Facebook, GMail, etc.) would then expose a nice API for querying by public key fingerprint: &quot;Who has 0xDEADBEEF?&quot; =&gt; &quot;@DeadBeef&quot;. Revocation, key updates, all that should be automatic: you revoke your public key and issue a replacement, all your services update automatically.<p>This is the point where lots of people will raise concerns about privacy: &quot;This means Twitter now must have access to my GMail account! WTF?!&quot;. No. This process must be voluntary and optional. If you want to have 200 different identities online, go for it. I don&#x27;t care to know your real name, I just care to know that I am talking only to the person I intend to talk to. Think emailing a well known developer on GitHub, having never met them. You don&#x27;t need their real name, you are only interested in them in so far as they publish OSS on GitHub. This allows you to prove that github.com&#x2F;example is @example on Twitter, example@example.com, example@gmail.com, and HN user &quot;example&quot;.<p>And the benefit to &quot;regular Joe&quot; is that when he emails his accountant, he can now send his credit card number and SSN without fear of eavesdropping.",Twitter,propos ui work automat use system simpli indic compos messag quot ye email address send mail belong person intend messag quot quot email address belong someon els quot quot brand new email address quot way email lawyer set email account tax info sure email right person b read commun <p> set system simpli requir link ident twitter facebook linkedin gmail hn govern allow easili link ident normal part account creation tie nice anoth chang get rid password use browser ui identifi la persona pgp base basic sign twitter option let upload one public key nice browser ui less twitter facebook gmail etc would expos nice api queri public key fingerprint quot 0 xdeadbeef quot gt quot @deadbeef quot revoc key updat automat revok public key issu replac servic updat automat <p> point lot peopl rais concern privaci quot mean twitter must access gmail account wtf quot process must voluntari option want 200 differ ident onlin go #x27 care know real name care know talk person intend talk think email well known develop github never met #x27 need real name interest far publish oss github allow prove github com #x2f exampl @exampl twitter exampl @exampl com exampl @gmail com hn user quot exampl quot <p> benefit quot regular joe quot email account send credit card number ssn without fear eavesdrop,0.06925701110483716,0.6210973205538423
2015-02-25 07:35:04,"&gt; <i>Learn to touch-type. This is an intermediate skill because writing code is so hard that the speed at which you can type is irrelevant and can&#x27;t put much of a dent in the time it takes to write code, no matter how good you are. However, by the time you are an intermediate programmer you will probably spend a lot of time writing natural language to your colleagues and others. This is a fun test of your commitment; it takes dedicated time that is not much fun to learn something like that. Legend has it that when Michael Tiemann[2] was at MCC people would stand outside his door to listen to the hum generated by his keystrokes which were so rapid as to be indistinguishable.</i><p>I know that this piece wasn&#x27;t written that long ago (2003)...but thinking back on those days of programming, I believe that so much has changed in information availability and operating systems that while fast touch-typing is still just an intermediate benefit, being able to memorize shortcuts and execute them by touch is of <i>enormous</i> benefit.<p>What I mean is that while Google was good in 2003, now I can type in an error message and basically be assured that the relevant Stack Overflow question will come up. Or maybe not, so I pop up a couple of Google searches, tabbing between windows as I type in my query. As those load up, I Alt-tab to my terminal window to re-run the problematic command, or at least examine it for typos. By then, at least one of my Google queries will have finished, so I Alt-Tab to my browser, click one of the search results, then Alt-Tab to the other Google query, click on one of <i>its</i> results. By this point, the Google search results that I skimmed over, or perhaps from the OneBox&#x2F;Direct Answer, has given me an idea to what my problem was. So while waiting for the actual pages linked from Google to load up, I alt-tab back into Terminal to see if any of those hints apply. If not, Alt-Tab to the browser, etc. etc.<p>Today I was teaching a student how to work with Twitter data from the command-line...and because Bash is not ideal for doing math or for parsing multi-line data...it took me a few tries of tabbing into a Bash reference manual, and many taps of the Up&#x2F;History key, and Ctrl-A&#x2F;Ctrl-E to navigate the prompt line, to come up with the command to calculate someone&#x27;s rate of Tweets (after hitting the API with a command-line program)...to the student, it must have looked like a constant stream of actual coding to get to the answer, when in fact, it was just a flurry of stupid mistakes and fixes in a span of a few seconds.<p>In the past, when a book was still often the best reference, or a very long webpage explanation...being able to quickly navigate the operating system may have not been such a big deal, as you were better served by just stopping your coding work to just read. Now (just as with all aspects of life and society), there seems to be a greater need to quickly navigate and filter information. I guess it&#x27;s a sort of multi-tasking...which may not always be ideal, but it is much <i>less</i> ideal if you&#x27;re multi-tasking and using your mouse to get around.",Twitter,"gt <i> learn touch-typ intermedi skill write code hard speed type irrelev #x27 put much dent time take write code matter good howev time intermedi programm probabl spend lot time write natur languag colleagu other fun test commit take dedic time much fun learn someth like legend michael tiemann 2 mcc peopl would stand outsid door listen hum gener keystrok rapid indistinguish </i> <p> know piec #x27 written long ago 2003 think back day program believ much chang inform avail oper system fast touch-typ still intermedi benefit abl memor shortcut execut touch <i> enorm </i> benefit <p> mean googl good 2003, type error messag basic assur relev stack overflow question come mayb pop coupl googl search tab window type queri load alt-tab termin window re-run problemat command least examin typo least one googl queri finish alt-tab browser click one search result alt-tab googl queri click one <i> </i> result point googl search result skim perhap onebox #x2f ;D irect answer given idea problem wait actual page link googl load alt-tab back termin see hint appli alt-tab browser etc etc <p> today teach student work twitter data command-lin bash ideal math pars multi-lin data took tri tab bash refer manual mani tap #x2f histori key ctrl-a #x2f ctrl-e navig prompt line come command calcul someon #x27 rate tweet hit api command-lin program student must look like constant stream actual code get answer fact flurri stupid mistak fix span second <p> past book still often best refer long webpag explan abl quickli navig oper system may big deal better serv stop code work read aspect life societi seem greater need quickli navig filter inform guess #x27 sort multi-task may alway ideal much <i> less </i> ideal #x27 multi-task use mous get around",0.15012254901960786,0.42291666666666666

The bridge is the void between the JS runtime’s thread and the main, UI’s one. This is incredibly painful when trying to do JS animations, sometimes if you’re not careful you can get hurt very badly. You can still do great things, but it’s way better to use the native `.animate()` methods, which cross the bridge only twice (at start, and at the end as a callback invoking).<p>On Native React you should not have this kind of problems because changes will be batched and updated on a update loop basis or at least debounced.

2014-07-14 02:11:22,"Wow, you are all over this thread. I take issue with the way you are jumping in here with a lot of assumptions. Please give me a moment to respond to your assertions point by point.<p>There is nothing glamorous about airing our faults and where we went wrong along the way, the points you enumerate were our beliefs to a &#x27;T&#x27; when we launched our second product a year and a half ago. A handful of these are right while others are mostly wrong or misguided.<p>1) This is a tough one to address. I see elsewhere in this thread you made the same mistake we did - namely thinking we could get 2mA with PS-POLL. While possible in the lab, that is simply not the case when working under conditions we&#x27;ve seen in the wild. Hypothetically if that were true you could see near instantaneous WiFi all the time. We were optimistic this may be possible but didn&#x27;t want to bet on it. We made the call that WiFi is advertised with instant response when someone is at the door and delayed response when in power save mode. If there is confusion we are quick to correct on Facebook, Twitter, and even our own blog[1]. Firmware updates to our WiFi chipset look promising but we are not committing to this.<p>2) Determining intent is a hard problem but hardly a fool&#x27;s errand. We don&#x27;t do this through just one BLE radio using RSSI alone as your comment implies[2]. The examples you give are both solvable with what we&#x27;ve built today. The harder problems come from platform inconsistency between iPhone and Android API&#x27;s. Android for instance only recently announced BLE support and when they did, the phone could only operate in one out of the two roles. Clearly other companies think similar home vs away intent is worth developing too[3][4].<p>3) Building a proper prototype without functional mechanicals is insane. Don&#x27;t do this. The other huge rabbit hole here is the word &#x27;reliably.&#x27; It&#x27;s like a client of a web design firm asking for 100% uptime.[5] The best you should do at the &#x27;hardware startup making a prototype&#x27; phase is to get it working on your target platform and solve known bugs so it works for 90 to 99.9% with loose specs or 100% of the time under tight optimal conditions. That said, things change. The way we were doing BLE security when we launched was thought to be secure. A ShmooCon talk instilled some doubts that while not broken it may not be the best foundation [6]. We rebuilt a lot of that with Diffie-Hellman and HMAC instead. We saw some connectivity issues with the new approach that were subsequently addressed. Other things change too. Our BLE chip switched from not using signed licenses to using signed licenses between updates. This caused us a bunch of frustration.<p>4) 40 hours of work to review a design is probably too little. We spent closer to 300 hours on the EE side with the most senior hacker we knew [7]. We worked with another firm on mechanics for 11 months prior to launch. In retrospect that feels about right for how much weight mechanical problems are vs electrical.<p>That $25-$30 number you site IS misleading. As an analogy, it is almost certainly possible to build a robot which can walk a straight line across a plastic table for this but getting it to walk across arbitrary terrain will cost you if your operating specs are unbounded (think Mars rover.) We know how to build a device that fits over locks for $25 without PCB - we are not happy with what level of performance that gets us.<p>5) This product however is not designed to be a replacement lock. We have made one of those in the past[8]. Saying something is wrong&#x2F;inefficient is true for anything asked to do something other than what it is made for. This model of Lockitron is designed to fit over a wide variety of existing locks precisely so that it can work for renters who can not change their locks. It is designed to do it in a way that it does not requires you to take your lock apart so it can be installed quickly and with next to zero mechanical aptitude. It does these things insanely well.<p>The numbers you site for gear vendors are again misleading. Yes, one can get gears for this cost in this time but you are shifting the burden of development and tooling elsewhere. Making this tradeoff in this case gets us towards a local maxima that is not the product&#x27;s desired function.<p>6) This is a bit naive. You don&#x27;t build to the spec if you&#x27;re seeing different results in the field. We saw this to be the case with sticky locks and jammy door frames. Other new locks can be put on a clean installation, we have to work with what&#x27;s there. Similarly, the Bluetooth 4.0 and 4.1 specs promise a lot of things which neither Apple nor Android support. In this case we build for what effects our customers experience not a certification checkbox - especially when that means exceeding the certifications standards.<p>And if anything that is the takeaway here. Building something to spec is a finite task with an estimable amount of work and calculable delivery date. Having real world conditions conflict with what was spec&#x27;ed introduces delays. Having conflicts across your product from metals and plastics up to software interfaces means these delays propagate.<p>You make the tough calls. You ship.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.lockitron.com/post/84539548097/debugging-jams-wifi-battery-notifications""

2014-07-10 12:51:05,"Hi, I am the creator of OtakuJam, and this is my first post on HN. I am looking for testers to help me test and fine tune my new social network project. I am also offering a contest for active members which ends next month for a $20 amazon gift card as a little incentive to help me gain some much needed testers.<p>Otakujam is a new social network (built on the buddypress engine) aimed at helping geeks connect with other geeks both online and off. It has entered open beta on 5&#x2F;27&#x2F;14 and is seeking testers to help suggest new features and test existing features.<p>It offers many familiar social networking features such as an activity stream where users can post updates, share photos and videos, and share and comment on other users&#x27; activities.<p>You can friend other users, or choose to follow them instead - the difference being that a follow does not require a confirmation from the other user. Users have complete control over their privacy levels and can choose which profile fields to make public, hide completely, or show to friends only.<p>The site&#x27;s main feature is &quot;Otaku Match&quot; which is a matchmaking script that allows users to search for other geeks based on the information included in their profiles.  All of the profile fields and data are customized to be of high relevancy to geek culture and include things such as a user&#x27;s favorite anime, or what books they are reading, or their favorite board games. Users&#x27; profile text is automatically converted into hyper links which when clicked, will take you to a page which displays other users who share these interests.<p>Most recently (in early July) OtakuJam began to focus on curated news content from geeky-related RSS feeds. It also added the ability for members of this social network to add their own articles, game reviews, and editorials which will appear on the site&#x27;s front page and news sections, as well as in a personal blog that each user can access via their OtakuJam profile. I have plans to add many game reviews and editorials myself over time, but mainly right now, there&#x27;s a lot of curated news more so than original content. Hopefully as time goes on and we get more active members, this will change and become a more balanced arena for news from the web as well as fresh original content.<p>Users can also join and create groups or participate in chat rooms or forums with other members. There&#x27;s also an events section where users can post and search for offline real world events which allows users to search as close as 5 miles or up to 100 miles from any given location.<p>Users can easily update their OtakuJam profiles by connecting to any of their social media accounts such as importing their instagram or flickr updates into Otakujam, or being able to use twitter to tweet out their OtakuJam status updates. Status updates can include hashtags and mentions which work similar to twitter in that they alert the person mentioned or help index content based on topic tags.<p>New features are being added constantly and a few upcoming features include the ability to watch streaming anime content and a steam api integration to display your games and achievements.<p>If any of this should happen to interest you we would love to see you join up on the site. Even if you decide not to join, if you have any feedback to give about the site, feel free to share it here in the comments.<p>Thanks for taking time to view my post, and have a happy Thursday :)",Twitter,hi creator otakujam first post hn look tester help test fine tune new social network project also offer contest activ member end next month 20 amazon gift card littl incent help gain much need tester <p> otakujam new social network built buddypress engin aim help geek connect geek onlin enter open beta 5 #x2f 27 #x2f 14 seek tester help suggest new featur test exist featur <p> offer mani familiar social network featur activ stream user post updat share photo video share comment user #x27 activ <p> friend user choos follow instead differ follow requir confirm user user complet control privaci level choos profil field make public hide complet show friend <p> site #x27 main featur quot ;O taku match quot matchmak script allow user search geek base inform includ profil profil field data custom high relev geek cultur includ thing user #x27 favorit anim book read favorit board game user #x27 profil text automat convert hyper link click take page display user share interest <p> recent earli juli otakujam began focu curat news content geeky-rel rss feed also ad abil member social network add articl game review editori appear site #x27 front page news section well person blog user access otakujam profil plan add mani game review editori time mainli right #x27 lot curat news origin content hope time goe get activ member chang becom balanc arena news web well fresh origin content <p> user also join creat group particip chat room forum member #x27 also event section user post search offlin real world event allow user search close 5 mile 100 mile given locat <p> user easili updat otakujam profil connect social media account import instagram flickr updat otakujam abl use twitter tweet otakujam statu updat statu updat includ hashtag mention work similar twitter alert person mention help index content base topic tag <p> new featur ad constantli upcom featur includ abil watch stream anim content steam api integr display game achiev <p> happen interest would love see join site even decid join feedback give site feel free share comment <p> thank take time view post happi thursday :),0.03956777597402598,0.4097050865800867
2014-07-05 12:54:06,"I think the issue is we&#x27;ve been slowly accepting that the node  is the right way to do things. Five years of working with someone will do that to you. If you follow me on twitter you probably see me complain about it in various ways all the time, it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m bored with it, node&#x27;s problems are real and some people just seem to ignore them, or maybe just deal with them because they know backwards compat can&#x27;t be broken immediately. It has always bothered me that people would advocate such broken systems (streams etc) when real-world alternatives were better even before now, even C has a much better example of what a stream should be.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not the only one writing large systems, but I think the tolerance level varies per developer. Also plenty of people make a living&#x2F;name from Node, of course they&#x27;re more likely to praise it than to be honest about its faults, I&#x27;m definitely a minority in that respect. Having broken concepts is one thing, but resisting change when they&#x27;re obviously broken is not a good thing. Many of these same people make money from consultation, where it&#x27;s advantageous to have a broken system. I&#x27;m not trying to screw them over but someone has to be honest.<p>It took years to get .addHeader() in because no one in core believed in a progressive API, they didn&#x27;t use node in real-world applications to see the need. This still happens all the time, take npm-www for example, Isaac is a rad guy but him aswell as most other &quot;core&quot; community members advocated building tiny little things and stitching them all together, and just recently realized that in practice this doesn&#x27;t scale, thus ended up going with Hapi. This lack of insight is all over Node as a community.<p>It&#x27;s hard to describe well, but I hope people will try Go (or similar alternative), you&#x27;ll really see how much more robust it is. If node fixed its conceptually flawed event system, rewrote http so it wasn&#x27;t awful to work with, and fixed streams then we&#x27;d have a pretty good system to work with. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to pass off problems with node as problems you&#x27;d have with any platform, but that&#x27;s unfortunately just not reality.",Twitter,think issu #x27 slowli accept node right way thing five year work someon follow twitter probabl see complain variou way time #x27 #x27 bore node #x27 problem real peopl seem ignor mayb deal know backward compat #x27 broken immedi alway bother peopl would advoc broken system stream etc real-world altern better even even c much better exampl stream <p> #x27 definit one write larg system think toler level vari per develop also plenti peopl make live #x2f name node cours #x27 like prais honest fault #x27 definit minor respect broken concept one thing resist chang #x27 obvious broken good thing mani peopl make money consult #x27 advantag broken system #x27 tri screw someon honest <p> took year get addhead one core believ progress api #x27 use node real-world applic see need still happen time take npm-www exampl isaac rad guy aswel quot core quot commun member advoc build tini littl thing stitch togeth recent realiz practic #x27 scale thu end go hapi lack insight node commun <p> #x27 hard describ well hope peopl tri go similar altern #x27 realli see much robust node fix conceptu flaw event system rewrot http #x27 aw work fix stream #x27 ;d pretti good system work #x27 <i> </i> easi pass problem node problem #x27 ;d platform #x27 unfortun realiti,0.10402056277056275,0.47136904761904763

Not everything about REST can be answered by &quot;just look at your browser&quot;, but a lot of things can.<p>If you follow a link you don&#x27;t care what the URL is. You never needed to type out &quot;&#x2F;reply&quot; to use Hacker News, you don&#x27;t need to do it to use an API.

2014-06-29 18:10:05,"well, none of these are really implemented (yet) but here you go<p>SW Only<p>1) An all-in-one transport app. You&#x27;d have a single credit wallet you could re-charge on a monthly&#x2F;weekly&#x2F;as-needed basis. You set in your profile for how long you are willing to wait for a ride(lets say +&#x2F;- 15min), and how far are you willing to walk from your current location(lets say r500m) + other criteria if you please(like ferraries-only:). Rates could be something like few cents&#x2F;km for &quot;civilian&quot; drivers(standard car-sharing - could be problematic depending on the legislature&#x2F;generated profit for the driver), few bucks&#x2F;km for cabs, pub transport based on routes&#x2F;times and - dynamic pub transport routes per km as well. Lets say there is a after-work beer with colleagues planned so you can&#x27;t drive to work by your self. During breakfast you just choose a destination(predefined for freq. places), desired time and a &quot;hitchhiker sign&quot;. All drivers doing the same&#x2F;similar route(with criteria compatible with yours) would be notified .. a few &quot;accept&quot; clicks away&#x2F;maybe a quick look at the drivers profile(badges&#x2F;km driven&#x2F;reviews etc) and your off to work. No drivers available? Your app would show you all public transport possibilities(color coded based on compatibility with your criteria) + cabs in your area - few clicks away and you&#x27;re set(either buying a ticket or ordering a cab). Double-validation for payments based on transport type - no more waiting on a bus stop for 2 hours watching 100&#x27;s of driver-only empty cars going your direction + a public API would mean that bus companies could also use small 6-8 passenger buses and dynamically create new&#x2F;amend existing routes based on the demand(200 people heading to a business park across town(C) from destination A, 100 from B to D(which is near C) between 0800 - 0900 &gt; change route via B .. if time intervals are met(like 1h from A - C) ) ++ all the data flowing your direction could also be used as a waze alternative for even better routing +++ you could profit by selling api data&#x2F;on % from commercial transport partners) + have awards for car-share folks like free oil&#x2F;filter changes after 10k km&#x2F;free coffee after 20km between 2200 - 0600 etc..). If you are in EU, these projects are highly welcomed..<p>2) We need a distributed decentralized(p2p), no-authority write once read many storage solution for &quot;our civilizations data&quot; like news&#x2F;general knowledge. It has to support versioning, encryption, deduplication, store synapses between relevant data, be self-healing, layered, nodes monitoring&#x2F;promoting(demoting)&#x2F;caranteening each other if needed, role-based - build on premise that all* of the nodes are&#x2F;can become malicious actors(..). Everyone should be able to run a node on his nas @home&#x2F;mobile device, assign roles to his devices etc .. general storage for all things public.. + it should support anonymous document uploads(lets say an indenpended journalist from syria wants to get his&#x2F;her story published &#x2F; someone working in a big-co comes across some very interesting public-interest documents he;d like to publish and doesn&#x27;t trust honey-pot assange&#x2F;media) - all big problems on their own .. regardless of the client app using the data(if you are running a auto-moto&#x2F;pro-(enter political party) website, you may apply as much filtering as you wish), the user should still be able to get&#x2F;contribute to the &quot;publicly-generated&quot; synaptic nw of a news story as stored on the backend + this is the bare minimum for other systems we desperately need to reform(the &quot;no-trust&quot; premise of it) so a good way to dive into this problematic<p>3) services on top of 2) .. and there are many ..<p>4) DNS, routing, ssl&#x2F;alternative, smtp replacement!  .. + ton of things you could do to make this world a better place.. please just don;t waste it on another twitter app<p>5) Clouds are here to stay, what has to change is the way we look at and work with data + connected with 2) + a few old concepts ms thought about pioneering a few years back, maybe its time for - yet another - linux distribution, combining best of today&#x27;s storage array internals, embedded systems, containers&#x2F;vm technology and security(..). In combination with some dedicated (hopefully usb-sized) hw .. could be a interesting time-waster<p>SW + HW<p>1) Easy-to-use&#x2F;build RF-net kits for low-bandwidth applications(irc&#x2F;messaging fe) - pick a protocol&#x2F;design your own, design a hierarchical topology of clients, ap&#x27;s, retransmitters, keep an eye on per-country rf encryption restrictions and hope you&#x27;ll never have to use it as your primary means of communication(eg no &quot;accidents&quot; on our main optic backbone)<p>2) HW keys to your cloud data&#x2F;apps - turning your PC into an accessory&#x2F;treating it the same like a cloud service provider with computing&#x2F;storage services available based on the pc-os setup .. maybe the x-server architecture could finally become applauded ..<p>&quot;HW&quot; Only<p>1) The idea of public work-places is great! soldering sets, measuring gear, 3d printers, tools for lease, benches for alu&#x2F;wood work etc - would probably be a hit anywhere(+ that equipment costs too much&#x2F;takes years to gather at home.. ) - there is a hobbyist in most of us + in combination with a caffee&#x2F;&quot;fun&quot; area&#x2F;library and city funding, you may even get into some green numbers<p>2) In combination with 1) - electronics tuning shop - if you like to get your hands dirty(building hw slider switches into phones&#x2F;nbs, custom cases&#x2F;hw customization - router fw&#x27;s etc) - you could get some traction if you;d presented your self as something underground&#x2F;anti-establishment .. these days..<p>3) bio and localized farming - huge opportunities, really bad business models(we;re talking about real bio producers struggling with the rising regulatory pressure lobbied by the big guys, not the so-called bio farmers selling out to those big-co&#x27;s) - monthly payments with 2x&#x2F;4x a month &quot;basket&quot;

2014-06-24 04:56:43,"I don&#x27;t think you are in any position to decide what I do or do not have a strong understanding of. Let&#x27;s break down your thoughts:<p>1.) Downtime - You seemed to gloss over my primary point. The downtime today could have been completely avoided if Heroku did not opt to do a 2pm EST scheduled maintenance. This was a very large risk they took and it blew up in everyone&#x27;s face.<p>As far as resolving downtime. I stand by my original statement that a PaaS like Heroku cannot recover as fast on average as another solution. They have too many customers that they have to get up and running.<p>5) Buildpacks - I&#x27;ve been fielding this one on Twitter all day and am considering writing another blog post. I didn&#x27;t really give much weight to this one and that opens it up to attack pretty easily. Here is my point:<p>Buildpacks in general do not suck. Heroku&#x27;s implementation of Buildpacks sucks. Customizing Heroku buildpacks is a nightmare. Maintaining said fork is nearly impossible. There is no versioning of the buildpacks. There is no way to know if&#x2F;when slugs are updated and my fork is no longer useable or needs to merge in upstream changes. Getting anything into the official buildpacks is a political nightmare. Adding CLI tools not in the heavily stripped down Ubuntu AMI is a gigantic pain in the ass.<p>But if that is not enough for you I&#x27;ll end this point with David Dollar who did a ton of work while at Heroku with its buildpacks <a href=""https://twitter.com/ddollar/status/481201978391801857"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ddollar&#x2F;status&#x2F;481201978391801857</a><p>re: puppet - I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re hammering me for Puppet as I never mentioned it.

Their DB hosting is awesome and top-notch. Their app hosting has become a less than stellar. I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m paying for anymore. To me managed devops means I don&#x27;t ever have to deal with pager duty or I can just hand customers over to someone after we launch their product. That&#x27;s not Heroku, not by a long shot.

2014-06-05 20:13:22,"It&#x27;s amazing how much effort SC put in making UI more sleek yet degrading UX thoroughly.<p>Stream is useless in its current form. It&#x27;s much inferior to Dashboard (which wasn&#x27;t perfect in the first place, but was quite usable, contrary to that one). For people taking SC activities seriously, like trying to listen most of the tracks coming from people they follow, there must be a way to hide&#x2F;collapse tracks that were already listened to (like removing in dashboard). What about favorites of people I follow? I maybe not use it extensively, but it&#x27;s a great way to discover new tracks. Dashboard provides it all and has a few tabs with different filtering and independent hiding (removing) and I would fix only this independence - removing entry in one tab should be enough and work for the other ones too - and improve the &quot;More&quot; button, to load at once everything that is left.<p>What should be clearly told is that new UI is definitely against any more thorough comments. Come on, showing only a few words? It&#x27;s like you encourage SCers to leave these useless comments. And there is no place for discussion at all. Personally I like to discuss things. Yet I understand others that don&#x27;t like comments at all on SC (because well, they are in fact often completely useless, as lot of SC users can express only praises or nothing), so they should be able to easily hide them.<p>Where are the features that everyone hoped for? Where are the marks next to the tracks that I already commented on them (and how many comments that were)? Where are the marks next to tracks that I already listened to? SoundCloud Next that was turned to be default is still more of a disaster than improvement. And it&#x27;s sad.<p>Somehow this I-don&#x27;t-care-about-UX-but-let&#x27;s-make-it-look-sexier-at-least attitude is becoming quite popular in internet, which is a paradox, because nowadays the opposite mind should be predominant. GitHub did in the last few years similar changes (they had a few good ones too, though) and had to disable comments in their blog to stop the never ending complaints... Another thing: less is more, but too less isn&#x27;t more at all. You have to preserve some basic functionality, otherwise removing features is like slapping users in the face. Here I can give Minus as an example - file sharing site that turned back into media sharing site w&#x2F; most of the features removed.<p>I think about doing some sane front-end using their API, but I always lack time to do stuff after hours...<p>If being bought by Twitter will help SC crew work better on UX, then I really hope it will happen.

2014-05-19 22:11:54,"First famo.us employee here, want to give people some food for thought to consider as you gripe about things like zoom and and the scrollbar (rightfully so). Some of the more controversial points, especially those regarding accessibility and progressive enhancement, made below are my own.<p>I think I&#x27;m the only person at the company that browses the web with JavaScript disabled, so I know how broken the original world wide web from when I first went online in 1994 is. I also remember using text-only browsers like lynx, and demonstrate it to co-workers on occasion. Lastly, I&#x27;ve been doing the web app development schtick for several years now and seen the good and the bad.<p>With all that in mind, the push towards progressive enhancement starting in 2003 when AJAX was just starting to become popular has proven to be a false prophet. IMHO, no idea has done more to make the web less accessible while also holding it back in terms of interactivity. You simply cannot use the same abstraction for both documents and applications and expect decent results for either.<p>What we should have done instead is allowed the two to diverge long ago and especially after 2007 when mobile computing took off and that change in screen size afforded us the opportunity to return to screens not all that dissimilar from those I remember using in &#x27;94. The first iPhone had a effective resolution of 320×480. You can effectively show as much on an iPhone as a 1994 computer monitor and have it be readable on both. In fact that&#x27;s basis of the &quot;Mobile First&quot; design paradigm that frameworks like Zurb Foundation have pushed for. Designing content for a single-wide column that scrolls up and down, that you can jump backward and forward on via anchor hypertext references was a really smart abstraction for lots of content. The site <a href=""http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherfuckingwebsite.com&#x2F;</a> illustrates this poignantly.<p>The technology direction we should have taken should have made sure that search engines, the blind (or otherwise disabled or dexterally challenged) actually remained the first class citizens on the web instead of taking the back seat to print designers and interaction designers. It&#x27;s easy to take the content designed for those constitutents and make it available via APIs that can then be consumed by people making rich web apps.<p>We even had something like that, it&#x27;s called RSS and it is glorious. RSS may have actually survived if it had not been for progressive enhancement which was crap but just good enough that people could get away with killing RSS off. Every technologist should make themselves familiar with the concept of path dependency (this Slate articles on the persistence of rockets as our primary way of putting objects in space is illustrative: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2011/02/space_stasis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slate.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;technology&#x2F;future_tense&#x2F;2011&#x2F;0...</a> ). Had progressive enhancement not become the road taken, no one would have ever argued to kill off RSS in favor of a hack jobbed DOM implemented where maybe 1 in 100 developers actually understood how to actually implement accessibility. RSS and other means of programmatic content consumption would have become the prime way of being indexable by search engines. Everyone would have maintained content that way because it would have been in their self interest to do so. Not only that, progressive enhancement is just usable enough to not get sued under the ADA. Without progressive enhancement, businesses (read: at least every fortune 500 company and then some) would have poured gobs money to into making sure they have the digital equivalent of wheelchair ramps. Progressive enhancement gave everyone the opportunity to do the least amount of effort and still maintain a defensible position if challenged legally.<p>The screen reading experience has been shit for like for ever and it&#x27;s only gotten worse as designs have become more complex. Skipping over the level of abstraction that made content usable programmatically not only impoverished those that need it, but those who don&#x27;t as well because we&#x27;re deprived of richer, more flexible APIs.<p>Having worked with webapps for a while, I think one of the most amazing improvements in the last 5 years has been the move towards displaying content on many more screens than just the desktop. This has forced us to go back to API solutions (usually REST, but sometimes RPC over websockets) that often ape what we originally tried to accomplish with RSS. This is the only sane way to provide content that needs to be displayed in different ways, from a Mobile First single long scroll page rendered by the server to a Famous&#x2F;Ember&#x2F;Angular&#x2F;Backbone&#x2F;React app that takes that server-rendered page and replaces it entirely with a rich interactive experience in the browser.<p>We (at famo.us) don&#x27;t yet have a solution for this future that treats everyone as a first class citizen, but we eventually plan to address this if the community doesn&#x27;t tackle it first. We&#x27;ve been inspired by a few attempts at figuring out how to achieve this. Spike Brehm and crew over at AirBnB have been exploring this with Rendr, that works with Backbone.js, <a href=""https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rendrjs&#x2F;rendr</a> , and August Lilleaas has worked on a solution for React, <a href=""http://augustl.com/blog/2014/jdk8_react_rendering_on_server/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;augustl.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jdk8_react_rendering_on_server&#x2F;</a> . We feel like there is potential for a generalized solution that doesn&#x27;t need to be necessarily tied to how one framework works.<p>If you look deep at Famo.us, we don&#x27;t throw out the DOM wholesale, instead we use the DOM where it matters. In Famo.us, there is a concept of a Surface (which is similar to Layers in CoreAnimation). The Surface is basically a container for HTML Document Fragments, usually fragments that are very strongly structured semantically. The entire scene graph above each Surface node basically helps you programmatically abstract away all the bullshit that many today handle awkwardly with levels and levels of DIV hell controlled by JavaScript. This is not only the abstraction that makes building things in Famo.us easy and fast, but also provides a boundary where content gets lumped into semantic chunks that oftentimes should be consumable for use in a long-scroll, semantically rich, Mobile First design where navigation is hyperlinked anchor based instead of spatial navigation.<p>When browsers were first designed, they made a decision to have a 1 to 1 relationship between the window object and the document object. While reasonable at the time (remember: small screens, low bandwidth, high latency), this proved unscalable to larger screens, greater bandwidth and lower latency. Take Twitter for example. Twitter.com is basically an application for displaying a tiny document called a Tweet. There hundreds of tweet documents shown at a time. The code for tweets is semantically rich. The code for the twitter app? That&#x27;s DIV hell. This is what Famo.us helps with. Like Flash and Silverlight before it, it helps apps be apps, but unlike its predecessors, it allows documents to be documents. Keeping these two separate keeps abstractions from leaking into each other in the code you write.<p>So while some things may be broken, and the way its broken may inspire ire, it&#x27;s important to understand that it&#x27;s not where the puck is that matters, but where it is going. The scrollview we&#x27;ve made is still inferior to the native scroller in a few ways, such as missing keyboard bindings, but are temporary shortcomings that we and the community are going to address in time. Eventually the feature and quality gap will narrow and the Famo.us scrollview(s) will reach parity with native scrollers.<p>Furthermore, some of the abstractions in the Famo.us scroller are remarkable for their programmatic flexibility. When most people think of a scroller, they only think of three scenarios: vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling and a pannable tiled area (like Google Maps or Open Street Maps). This is actually a pretty limited view of what&#x27;s possible to explore if you abstract a scroller to its essence. A scroller at is essential is a mathematical set with a curser and that all scrolling does (whether by mouse or keyboard) is move the cursor position in that set. When you think about it that way, many more things you&#x27;ve seen are scrollers. For example, the Apple Time machine view is a scroller in the Z-direction. CoverFlow is another scroller that is horizontal, but where the affine matrix transform applied to a surface is based on the distance of a surface from the cursor and inverts on each side of the cursor. One team of beta testers used the scroll view to display a DNA double helix. It was basically two position linked vertical-scrollers, where the positioner function didn&#x27;t just set the position on the Y-axis, but also manipulated the affine matrix to create the helix shape.<p>While probably not the best approach, even Google&#x27;s new interactive Rubik&#x27;s cube doodle could probably be implemented as a series of Famo.us scrollers. Each scroller would contain 12 surfaces (doubly linked in a ring), with pagination occurring at every three surfaces. The pagination function instead of translating the surfaces along only one axis instead rotates all the surfaces 90 degrees around an axis. All surfaces would belong to two scrollers &quot;perpendicular&quot; to one another at any given time, being lifted from one to the other and back depending on which one was in motion.<p>And since all this is based on the same scroller, which will eventually reach parity with native scrollers, it means that they get all the same features. Home goes to the top of a vertical scroller, the left of a western horizontal scroller, the beginning of the double helix or the begging of time in z-axis time machine like scroller. End does the opposite.<p>These examples just begin to scratch the surface of what&#x27;s possible when you expose primitives that map to mathematical concepts like a set and current index to developers.<p>Last, but not least, we&#x27;re going to look at all the feedback on the scrollview and try to address all the issues you all have encountered.",Twitter,"first famo us employe want give

2014-02-11 19:47:21,"The Bitcoin protocol is the Satoshi client; the Satoshi client is the Bitcoin protocol.  No Bitcoin protocol exists outside of the single source of truth, which is &quot;how does the Satoshi client actually operate?&quot;<p>Both exchanges use the JSON&#x2F;RPC interface to the Satoshi bitcoin client.  That is the One True Way to use Bitcoin to develop Bitcoin-consuming applications.  To do otherwise is madness.  (I&#x27;ve seen explanations that Mt. Gox was using a custom client, but I believe they mean &quot;Mt. Gox was using a custom system which took care of bookkeeping for itself, because the Satoshi client cannot operate thousand of wallets in any sane fashion, but used the Satoshi client for interacting with the Bitcoin network.&quot;)<p>The Bitcoin RPC interface exposes many methods.  I don&#x27;t have intimate knowledge of which one these exchanges were using, but since they all have similar issues, let&#x27;s assume they used sendtoaddress.<p>The message signature of sendtoaddress is (pseudo-code):<p><pre><code>   #returns transaction_id\n   sendtoaddress(from_account, to_bitcoin_address, amount, optional_message)  \n</code></pre>\nThe mistake which both exchanges made is they assumed transaction_id is the same transaction_id used for gettransaction(transaction_id).  It is.  If you send a transaction, wait an hour, and then get it by ID, that will work.<p>But it isn&#x27;t.  Transaction ID means absolutely nothing.  It can be changed by any party, worldwide, for up to one hour after the invocation of sendtoaddress.  If you use gettransaction(transaction_id) and it returns nil, that does not prove that the transaction you previously created did not succeed correctly.  You should not attempt to retry the transaction until first verifying that you have all the coins you started with and that the recipient does not have some of your coins.  You can conveniently do this with an O(n) scan over all Bitcoin transactions ever.  (Someone pointed out to me on twitter that it isn&#x27;t O(n) if you have your database indices set properly.  Well, yeah, true.)<p>You&#x27;ll need to know what addresses you actually sent from, which is obscured by the sentoaddress API described above, for that scan to succeed, so essentially you&#x27;re going to reimpliment much of the Satoshi Bitcoin client, particularly around the area of wallet management.  Don&#x27;t reimpliment everything, though -- down that path lies madness.

Nope. Ok, I&#x27;ll open my contact book, and get their number to call.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to simply select the person I&#x27;m trying to reach, and see what platforms they&#x27;re online, so I can choose my contact method?<p>Or what if I want to see what&#x27;s new with one friend?

Instead, it returns HTML. That&#x27;s fine. No one said API can&#x27;t return HTML.<p>When some part of the Twitter API becomes unavailable, the API server should return 503 when we asks those APIs to return response. If these bad APIs are also used to power some part of the frontend, then the frontend will not work properly. For example, viewing thumbnail from dashboard may be down. But the rest of the page is functioning. In that case, you can&#x27;t send 503 from the frontend. It doesn&#x27;t make sense.

2013-11-20 14:39:05,"I would say that people, and their reasons for objecting to surveillance or having privacy concerns far are more complicated and varied than you are imagining.  Some of the people who have expressed concerns may be:<p>Citizens concerned about government officials overstepping constitutional bounds and lying about it, but not particularly concerned about the practical consequences of the surveillance.<p>Activists for whom NSA surveillance confirms that government  is not on the side of the people, but whose sense of history leads them to the conclusion that if massive FBI files, Jim Crow laws, and lynching did not stop the Civil Rights movement, metadata is unlikely to prevent the arc of history bending towards justice.<p>“Airbus nationalists” in Europe who are, in their heart, more concerned about the fact the EU seems to be incapable of developing a Facebook, Google, Twitter, ect. They may ape the language of their fellow citizens whose privacy concerns are based on Nazi&#x2F;Stasi&#x2F;etc. historical experience, but actually view cloud computing as industrial policy struggle.  Video game manufacture is likely not their strategic priority.<p>People with specific consequentialist privacy concerns.  For example, someone who hates Facebook because it has caused something embarrassing to be shared without their truly informed consent. They may be indifferent to the notion that embarrassing information is hidden on a government database, and they may actually welcome and value that Google algorithms leverage their g-mail and search history to serve up more relevant ads.<p>People who once cared, but are so sick of monomaniacs hijacking every HN discussion that they are looking forward to buying an Xbox One simply as a sign of contempt.  They likely also once were vaguely sympathetic to Google Reader users, but now see the product discontinuation as just punishment of tiresome and entitled whiners.<p>You may feel that all of these types of  people are wrongheaded, but change often happens because large groups of loosely affiliated people band together, and rarely because zealots double down and fail to see why anyone might <i>consider</i> a different point of view.",Twitter,would say peopl reason object surveil privaci concern far complic vari imagin peopl express concern may <p> citizen concern govern offici overstep constitut bound lie particularli concern practic consequ surveil <p> activist nsa surveil confirm govern side peopl whose sens histori lead conclus massiv fbi file jim crow law lynch stop civil right movement metadata unlik prevent arc histori bend toward justic <p> “ airbu nationalist ” europ heart concern fact eu seem incap develop facebook googl twitter ect may ape languag fellow citizen whose privaci concern base nazi #x2f stasi #x2f etc histor experi actual view cloud comput industri polici struggl video game manufactur like strateg prioriti <p> peopl specif consequentialist privaci concern exampl someon hate facebook caus someth embarrass share without truli inform consent may indiffer notion embarrass inform hidden govern databas may actual welcom valu googl algorithm leverag g-mail search histori serv relev ad <p> peopl care sick monomaniac hijack everi hn discuss look forward buy xbox one simpli sign contempt like also vagu sympathet googl reader user see product discontinu punish tiresom entitl whiner <p> may feel type peopl wronghead chang often happen larg group loos affili peopl band togeth rare zealot doubl fail see anyon might <i> consid </i> differ point view,-0.24502164502164503,0.5841991341991342
2013-11-17 07:30:39,"A comment I left a few weekends ago, which addressed the same topic but before the Youtube&#x2F;G+ story broke: [0]<p>&quot;Hijacking the top comment to talk about a big concern I have. This EFF article argues that there&#x27;s a place for Anonymity on the Internet [1], and I think most of us agree (especially if we emphathize with those in Iran, China, Syria, and the like).<p>But what HNers must realize is the following: The mainstream Internet <i>can not become</i> the Tor-visited Dark-Net (which restores anonymity) that many believe is inevitable WITHOUT losing its positive sociological impact. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, even HN rely on anonymity and also provide a great deal of such value.  Here&#x27;s a simple example of &#x27;sociological impact&#x27;: CNN (FoxNews, etc) pays attention to what the top links on Reddit are, because the site is in the public&#x27;s face -- and: the people have a collective voice.<p>Next: Without the perception of anonymity, sites like Reddit will stop flourishing.<p>Let&#x27;s go deeper:  Reddit&#x27;s culture thrives on &quot;anonymity&quot; in the form of throwaway accounts and people being themselves without representing themselves.  Throwaway accounts (heard of &#x27;Cation Bot&#x27; or &#x27;AWildSketchAppeared&#x27;?) are a form of expression unique to environments which allow for anonymity (pseudonyms). Who&#x27;s to say novelty accounts would be as risque or hilarious without anonymity?  Certainly these sites flourish because users feel comfortable playing a part and taking a chance.<p>There are two issues at play which threaten anonymity on Reddit. Now obvious (in light of Snowden&#x27;s leaks): 1.) Reddit usernames can, and probably are, being mapped to peoples&#x27; actual identity. ... Not as obvious: 2.) Users&#x27; up and down votes, even private messages, can also be sniffed with ease.<p>Reddit&#x27;s&#x27; devteam has retreated from the idea of providing HTTPS for its voting&#x2F;web API [2], so people&#x27;s actions (aside from comments) can be mapped as well. I tried to raise awareness of this issue five months ago [3].  I know there&#x27;s an argument to be made that SSL&#x2F;HTTPS is useless anyway (just use Tor!, they say), but the bigger question remains:<p>Can a mainstream community such as Reddit exist in tomorrow&#x27;s Internet?  I&#x27;d say that such web-societies are fragile -- likely targets of dragnet surveillance and subversion, especially given their disruptive nature.<p>People and the press are paranoid about Facebook&#x2F;Google privacy because its users (are encouraged to) identify themselves <i>explicitly</i>, but the reality is no different with sites like Reddit - just the perception. Just think about how much more is shared on a site like Reddit by its members because of their pseudonyms! Few people aside from the avid Tor-using&#x2F;&#x2F;r&#x2F;netsec crowd have realized this.<p>Reddit is the internet &quot;as we know it,&quot; and I feel the Internet is about to change.<p>In hindsight - Google&#x27;s initial &quot;no pseudonyms&quot; policy for Google+ was prescient -- though the company eventually capitulated to popular demand for them. [4] Perhaps they wished to save each of us the unsavory realization that aliases exist in name-only (pun intended). :&#x2F;&quot;<p>[0] <a href=\""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6652909\"" rel=\""nofollow\"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6652909</a>\n[1] <a href=\""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/online-anonymity-not-only-trolls-and-political-dissidents\"" rel=\""nofollow\"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;online-anonymity-not-o...</a> \n[2] <a href=\""http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/l4n6y/reddit_change_log_in_with_ssl_javascript_fixes/\"" rel=\""nofollow\"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;changelog&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l4n6y&#x2F;reddit_chan...</a>\n[3] <a href=\""http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n73s0/again_reddit_needs_fullsite_https/\"" rel=\""nofollow\"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1n73s0&#x2F;again_reddit...</a> [4] <a href=\""http://www.ibtimes.com/google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-aliases-399584\"" rel=\""nofollow\"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibtimes.com&#x2F;google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-...</a>",Twitter,"comment left weekend ago address topic youtub #x2f g stori broke 0 <p> quot hijack top comment talk big concern eff articl argu #x27 place anonym internet 1 think us agre especi emphath iran china syria like <p> hner must realiz follow mainstream internet <i> becom </i> tor-visit dark-net restor anonym mani believ inevit without lose posit sociolog impact site like reddit twitter even hn reli anonym also provid great deal valu #x27 simpl exampl #x27 sociolog impact #x27 cnn foxnew etc pay attent top link reddit site public #x27 face peopl collect voic <p> next without percept anonym site like reddit stop flourish <p> let #x27 go deeper reddit #x27 cultur thrive quot anonym quot form throwaway account peopl without repres throwaway account heard #x27 cation bot #x27 #x27 awildsketchappear #x27 form express uniqu environ allow anonym pseudonym #x27 say novelti account would risqu hilari without anonym certainli site flourish user feel comfort play part take chanc <p> two issu play threaten anonym reddit obviou light snowden #x27 leak 1 reddit usernam probabl map peopl #x27 actual ident obviou 2 user #x27 vote even privat messag also snif eas <p> reddit #x27 #x27 devteam retreat idea provid http vote #x2f web api 2 peopl #x27 action asid comment map well tri rais awar issu five month ago 3 know #x27 argument made ssl #x2f http useless anyway use tor say bigger question remain <p> mainstream commun reddit exist tomorrow #x27 internet #x27 ;d say web-societi fragil like target dragnet surveil subvers especi given disrupt natur <p> peopl press paranoid facebook #x2f googl privaci user encourag identifi <i> explicitli </i> realiti differ site like reddit percept think much share site like reddit member pseudonym peopl asid avid tor-us #x2f #x2f r #x2f netsec crowd realiz <p> reddit internet quot know quot feel internet chang <p> hindsight googl #x27 initi quot pseudonym quot polici googl prescient though compani eventu capitul popular demand 4 perhap wish save us unsavori realiz alias exist name-onli pun intend #x2f quot <p> 0 <a href=\""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6652909\"" rel=\""nofollow\""> http #x2f #x2f news ycombin com #x2f item id 6652909 </a> n 1 <a href=\""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/online-anonymity-not-only-trolls-and-political-dissidents\"" rel=\""nofollow\""> http #x2f #x2f www eff org #x2f ;d eeplink #x2f 2013 #x2f 10 #x2f ;o nline-anonymity-not-o </a> n 2 <a href=\""http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/l4n6y/reddit_change_log_in_with_ssl_javascript_fixes/\"" rel=\""nofollow\""> http #x2f #x2f www reddit com #x2f r #x2f changelog #x2f comment #x2f l4n6i #x2f reddit_chan </a> n 3 <a href=\""http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n73s0/again_reddit_needs_fullsite_https/\"" rel=\""nofollow\""> http #x2f #x2f www reddit com #x2f r #x2f ;p rivaci #x2f comment #x2f 1 n73s0 #x2f again_reddit </a> 4 <a href=\""http://www.ibtimes.com/google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-aliases-399584\"" rel=\""nofollow\""> http #x2f #x2f www ibtim com #x2f google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonym </a>",0.19000000000000003,0.37444444444444447

The name I have is InfoStream (not Trademarked), and the domain is infostre.am (not currently in use). I will E-mail and tell you more about what I was envisioning in terms of my project, and we&#x27;ll see how it matches up with your vision. If we have a match, maybe we can work on it together (or maybe I can contribute somehow). The problem I came up with was Monetization, specifically on the Twitter Platform. Twitter seems to be the best source of real time information, but when they introduced API 1.1 and the (IMO) extremely gray 1.5 rule (do not replicate the core twitter experience) I placed this project on the back burner. It just does not make sense to dedicate time to a project on a platform that will likely pull the plug [1]. In many ways, the vision I have (InfoStream) is replicating the core Twitter experience. I find Twitter&#x27;s approach towards filtering data (lists) and presenting data to the user (single context feed) to be extremely weak, and ripe for innovation. Yet delivering this information is the core Twitter experience, and thus even though I think I can provide methods to deliver information better (more contextually accurate, more valuable), this is not what Twitter wants. So I end up where lots of other people have ended up; Could build something cool on Twitter, but it&#x27;s just too unstable from a Developers perspective. If you can think of other Sources for real time data that are not as controlling, more trustworthy, and&#x2F;or easier to Monetize, I&#x27;m open to trying a different approach. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think Twitter is a good choice. And I am hoping that an IPO will change things (but I&#x27;m not sure).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130417052642-32720-my-worst-career-mistake-build-in-someone-else-s-garden"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;today&#x2F;post&#x2F;article&#x2F;20130417052642-32...</a>",Twitter,"#x27 sure exactli #x27 envis #x27 work side project sound similar name infostream trademark domain infostr current use e-mail tell envis term project #x27 see match vision match mayb work togeth mayb contribut somehow problem came monet specif twitter platform twitter seem best sourc real time inform introduc api 1.1 imo extrem gray 1.5 rule replic core twitter experi place project back burner make sens dedic time project platform like pull plug 1 mani way vision infostream replic core twitter experi find twitter #x27 approach toward filter data list present data user singl context feed extrem weak ripe innov yet deliv inform core twitter experi thu even though think provid method deliv inform better contextu accur valuabl twitter want end lot peopl end could build someth cool twitter #x27 unstabl develop perspect think sourc real time data control trustworthi #x2f ;o r easier monet #x27 open tri differ approach unfortun #x27 think twitter good choic hope ipo chang thing #x27 sure <p> 1 <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130417052642-32720-my-worst-career-mistake-build-in-someone-else-s-garden"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f www linkedin com #x2f today #x2f ;p ost #x2f articl #x2f 20130417052642 32 </a>",0.265,0.4501851851851852

2013-09-11 13:23:51,"Well, of course cards are semantically equal to RSS feeds or HTML tags - the card is a presentation concept for the idea of a &quot;container&quot;, after all; programmatically, they can be treated the same as any other information block.<p>What changes is that they&#x27;re now visible to the end user, while their structure previously could only be accessed by the system&#x27;s developer. Now they can be published through an API, or directly manipulated from a GUI; that&#x27;s a change in focus - the same operations can be done on the content, but different people can perform them if they are published as atomic cards instead of embedded in larger, whole documents.<p>Semantic-aware interfaces are less based on applications and more on tasks. These interfaces work just like with the old CLI, where instead of loading data into an app (where available commands are selected and composed by the developer), you have a information flowing through a &quot;pipe&quot; of independent commands selected by the user from all commands available in the system. Environments like KDE Plasma Active [1] (still app-based, but with &quot;Activities&quot; that represent tasks), or the old Cannon Cat and its spiritual succesor Archy (which was a graphical version of Emacs, sort of) [2], are examples of this model of interaction. These are not new concepts, really, but they&#x27;ve never been fully realized in graphical interface (afaik only the Canon Cat and Emacs follow them, and both are text-based).<p>Yes, Google Reader is a good example of the kind of content aggregation and sharing that I&#x27;m pursuing with my ideal system (and many people found it useful, so there&#x27;s an 	
audience for it). Google Now is another system which has chosen the card metaphor to show information according to context. But Reader was not programmable, as it had fixed styling that couldn&#x27;t be changed by the end-user; and Google Now has fixed rules created by the provider, not the user. I believe that the card is a natural data structure for people that don&#x27;t have a programming background to create simple procedures, that would allow users to create new behaviors for these tools.<p>You&#x27;ve given me some thoughts to chew with the &quot;more confusing than twitter, less powerful than raw data&quot;; I&#x27;m certainly aiming for &quot;more powerful than twitter&quot;, and I&#x27;ll have to ponder how to achieve that without making it too confusing.

2012-09-06 13:05:15,"Hey Diligu friends - Great job launching something especially in the music business space.<p>Some feedback:<p>1. The head line ""we f*cking love music"" is not about me the user it's about you the company.  While it's nice to know it doesn't tell anything about the website.<p>2. Some spacing between the picture, the ""Want to ..."" and the list of songs would help give the elements some breathing room.<p>3. On the top bar on the front page you have ""Start"", ""Join Today"" and ""Sign In"".  The ""Start"" link just takes me back to the front page.  This was confusing as I thought that ""Start"" and ""Join Today"" were actually the same thing.<p>4. I like the idea though dislike the people you are going to charge.  Minor artists rarely have extra funds to through around on marketing that is not directly tied to concerts, t-shirts, stickers, etc.  Here you are asking minor artists to pay for people they want to reach without actually (at least where I could see) trying to convince me as a minor artist that a) you have enough people for me to care, b) that they are worth paying, and c) that they really are worth 10 cents per user.<p>5. Outside of the three free songs on the front page - it's not clear to me that is has anything to do with microblogging or music-discovery or that as an artist that I can buy audiences.<p>6. If it is a microblogging website, I'd love to browse users or artists without having to sign up/in with twitter and/or facebook.<p>7. Using uservoice - i'm not always a fan of this because I clicked on it and all I saw were problems that people had with your service that I hadn't even thought about.  Note - this isn't to say that you should hide the problems.<p>8. In the footer you link to API and then when I click into it you tell me that you don't have anything ready and that I should contact you to tell you what I want.  Perhaps it's better to not say anything until you actually have it?  Otherwise it really raises expectations and makes the product feel incomplete.<p>9. In the footer you also have twitter (blog).  For me these are two very different things so I was surprised that they went to the same place.  In a similar point to the API, if you don't have a blog, that's cool - just don't put it so that expectations are kept on the right things.<p>10. If you are going to sell audiences, are you going to provide some money back to users?<p>11. I tried to sign up using twitter.  What you want to do with my twitter account is pretty crazy - especially ""Update your profile.""  There is no way that I would ever sign up for a service has the ability to change my twitter profile.  Also, tweeting out for me is my boundary line.  Also somewhat shocking is following new people for me.  Perhaps I haven't been using all the new music startups, but for a website that i'm supposed to be using to discover new music, these seem like pretty harsh consequences for signing up.<p>12. So I signed up/in anyway to give feedback.  Once I sign up you then ask me to come up with a user name.  Couldn't you have used my twitter account?  This extra step doesn't add anything to your service (haven't seen what this user account will be used for or what it means) so it's just another step that would make me want to close the browser.<p>13. I selected a genre ""indie"" and then couldn't figure out how to move to the next steps.  I finally realized after clicking on a ton of stuff that I had to click on something that looks like a pasta shell.  When I hover over it the eye opens and it says follow.  This is really hard to understand and doesn't tell me what to do.<p>14. If I click on indie / electro / pop user ""Peng"" is at the top of the list for all of them.  If I click sequentially, I don't actually see the list of people change so it makes it look like these are the only people that I'll be able to follow.  perhaps make this random so at least it makes it look like there's all type of users.<p>15. I'm not entirely sure why I want to follow people or how it will make my life awesome.  Most of the text talks about Diligu not why following people will make my life awesome.<p>16. I followed user ""peng"", then I go to step two and you ask for more credentials to more services?  Here is where I stopped.  This is way too hard and way too many steps to jump through before I can even start enjoying the service.<p>17. I skipped the rest of the steps and the first thing I see when I finally get in is a huge ad telling me to give you my facebook credentials so that it can find new friends for me.  So far i've spend like 10 minutes trying to get into the website and no value has been provided to me yet.<p>I like the idea of a twitter where the followers I can follow are based exclusively on their musical tastes.  However, I think you have to rethink your onboarding process and how to add value to the user right off of the bat.<p>Good luck and keep us updated!",Twitter,hey diligu friend great job launch someth especi music busi space <p> feedback <p> 1 head line f cking love music user compani nice know tell anyth websit <p> 2 space pictur want list song would help give element breath room <p> 3 top bar front page start join today sign start link take back front page confus thought start join today actual thing <p> 4 like idea though dislik peopl go charg minor artist rare extra fund around market directli tie concert t-shirt sticker etc ask minor artist pay peopl want reach without actual least could see tri convinc minor artist enough peopl care b worth pay c realli worth 10 cent per user <p> 5 outsid three free song front page clear anyth microblog music-discoveri artist buy audienc <p> 6 microblog websit i'd love brows user artist without sign twitter facebook <p> 7 use uservoic i'm alway fan click saw problem peopl servic even thought note say hide problem <p> 8 footer link api click tell anyth readi contact tell want perhap better say anyth actual otherwis realli rais expect make product feel incomplet <p> 9 footer also twitter blog two differ thing surpris went place similar point api blog that' cool put expect kept right thing <p> 10 go sell audienc go provid money back user <p> 11 tri sign use twitter want twitter account pretti crazi especi updat profil way would ever sign servic abil chang twitter profil also tweet boundari line also somewhat shock follow new peopl perhap use new music startup websit i'm suppos use discov new music seem like pretti harsh consequ sign <p> 12 sign anyway give feedback sign ask come user name use twitter account extra step add anyth servic seen user account use mean anoth step would make want close browser <p> 13 select genr indi figur move next step final realiz click ton stuff click someth look like pasta shell hover eye open say follow realli hard understand tell <p> 14 click indi electro pop user peng top list click sequenti actual see list peopl chang make look like peopl i'll abl follow perhap make random least make look like there' type user <p> 15 i'm entir sure want follow peopl make life awesom text talk diligu follow peopl make life awesom <p> 16 follow user peng go step two ask credenti servic stop way hard way mani step jump even start enjoy servic <p> 17 skip rest step first thing see final get huge ad tell give facebook credenti find new friend far i'v spend like 10 minut tri get websit valu provid yet <p> like idea twitter follow follow base exclus music tast howev think rethink onboard process add valu user right bat <p> good luck keep us updat,0.11942099567099568,0.47731998556998556

2012-08-27 21:43:56,"&#62; If the app wishes to not show ads or to use twitter for more of an ""infrastructure-like"" purpose, then there should be some kind of use-fee-based pricing model on the API side.<p>No need for this complexity. They could just revoke API access for apps that don't show ads per their guidelines. It'd be easy to catch any Twitter client with a significant user base that isn't showing ads properly.<p>At the end of the day though solutions like this just aren't realistic. If Twitter's going to show ads and other content like cards in their stream, advertisers have to have confidence that the content and presentation will be preserved. The only way to truly do this effectively is to control how your product is presented in all cases.<p>The problem isn't that Twitter's making these changes. The problem is that Twitter's only getting around to doing this now, years after a vibrant ecosystem of third-party clients has been well established. No one complains that there isn't a rich market for third-party Facebook clients, even though the Facebook app historically has been pretty substandard. Facebook, wisely, never relinquished control over their platform.<p>Twitter, as ever, is cleaning up for previous incompetence, trying to clean up a mess that never should have existed.

2012-06-30 20:14:07,"As a developer I too a, disappointed by Twitter's move to restrict API access as it has but again, still as a developer, I can understand Twitter's point of view and I'll actually say what they're doing is smart and other sites should follow suit.<p>We all want our API access, we want it now, we want it free, and we want it unrestricted whether we monetize our use of another app's API or not. But unfortunately we can't just feed off Twitter's teet and expect them to just cater to our every want. API access is a privilege, not a right. By monetizing their API as they are they are avoiding the most common mistake that afflicts tech startups - the problem of monetization. They have their ""verified"" accounts and ""promoted tweets"" which is a good start and now that the API has become so valuable they are monetizing this. They're a company that offers a free service and making a true profit instead of just taking on VC money and hoping someone will figure out how they'll make money later. They did this at just the right time too. They are now an established player much like Facebook. Now that users are locked in and so many people are getting value from Twitter's quick information sharing and marketing capabilities they made a smart decision with this new monetization strategy.<p>We all should have known the free ride would end eventually. In many cases, apps using the API are actually competing with twitter itself! Surely you can't expect Twitter to allow competing apps like iOS and Android apps to outshine them. So these restrictions force those competing clients to actually innovate still! Yes, access to tweets are limited but apps like Hootsuite and others have found ways to use the API in other ways like scheduling tweets.<p>I'll definitely concede that I think their limits are a bit strict and they are pretty much only useful for hobby projects. At the same time, though, we've become spoiled and entitled and I can definitely understand the restrictions. Reactions to policies like this are to be expected. Everyone always throws a fit when these things happen but we'll live and we have to understand that Twitter needs money to run so they can provide an API at all and if we want to make a buck off Twitter's API we can't expect a free ride. That's like asking the owner of an office building to let you use office space free because... Well... It's there. That said, they need to be smart about this too. Too much restriction will hurt them but too little will mean they aren't generating what they need. But right now I don't think we can judge whether these policies are really that bad because, like I said, any time a service makes these changes everyone starts complaining and a lot of exaggeration goes on.",Twitter,develop disappoint twitter' move restrict api access still develop understand twitter' point view i'll actual say they'r smart site follow suit <p> want api access want want free want unrestrict whether monet use anoth app' api unfortun can't feed twitter' teet expect cater everi want api access privileg right monet api avoid common mistak afflict tech startup problem monet verifi account promot tweet good start api becom valuabl monet they'r compani offer free servic make true profit instead take vc money hope someon figur they'll make money later right time establish player much like facebook user lock mani peopl get valu twitter' quick inform share market capabl made smart decis new monet strategi <p> known free ride would end eventu mani case app use api actual compet twitter sure can't expect twitter allow compet app like io android app outshin restrict forc compet client actual innov still ye access tweet limit app like hootsuit other found way use api way like schedul tweet <p> i'll definit conced think limit bit strict pretti much use hobbi project time though we'v becom spoil entitl definit understand restrict reaction polici like expect everyon alway throw fit thing happen we'll live understand twitter need money run provid api want make buck twitter' api can't expect free ride that' like ask owner offic build let use offic space free well said need smart much restrict hurt littl mean gener need right think judg whether polici realli bad like said time servic make chang everyon start complain lot exagger goe,0.17995036572622786,0.5054591481315619

While then I completely disregarded it, now I'm even more so disregarding it.<p>I choose the right tool for the right task. Linger on that over-used saying for a moment.<p>I use Rails when I'm not familiar with the domain enough (this is the business of Software Engineering, we never are as familiar with the domain as the domain experts) and it provides me a platform for radically fast development, in the end I may also have a product that can withhold 2-3 years of evolution, before we need to scale, if even needed (premature optimization..).<p>I also use Rails when the quality levels are set high, and when I need tons of libraries, and I need those fast. In node, the quality level of such libraries are much worse (if you haven't seen it, you're not doing Node enough time - because I haven't seen it at my first half a year on Node). The number of quality libraries / npm modules are probably several magnitudes of order less than that of Ruby gem world. You're going to need to wait 4 years until you get that level of diversity and quality and it sets up in a comparable way.<p>And I use Ruby when I don't care about slow clients, or doing system-level work.<p>At any given time, I keep myself the option to use JRuby, which has comparable to MRI (the ""normal"", C implementation of Ruby) performance and better on a considerable number of criteria. IMHO DynamicInvoke on the JVM will be a game changer in terms of people considering JRuby against, Groovy, or Scala.<p>I use node.js when I know the domain will remain small, non-complex, and I'll be dealing with slow clients (real users).<p>To top all of that, backend systems will NOT turn into thin api servers. Not by any chance. Twitter themselves are rolling back their SPA and bringing back server side template rendering. The number of problem you get into while moving all of your logic and rendering to the client requires a huge blog post which I'll probably make one day. Most people are not aware of that because they never came from full-fledged enterprise level desktop apps -- I used to design CADs and pretty familiar with complex client-side architectures, there are so many dragons there, I'm very happy I now live on the server side, where things are much more predictable.<p>So no, Rails is not dying and neither is Ruby. With the advent of progress on the JVM and JRuby they never will -- this whole discussion reminds me of ""Java is about to die"" when Scala came around and ""Java is about to die"" when Oracle came around. And guess what - it didn't (go read about Java 8).<p>tldr; I use both, and I'd recommend anyone would, too. Server-side will never be just a thin api, Ruby or Rails will not die (at least not by that sword), and the only thing one might want to work on is a good foundation of intuition of when to use which of those.<p>@jondot",Twitter,heard first call rail dead around 7 8 month ago complet disregard i'm even disregard <p> choos right tool right task linger over-us say moment <p> use rail i'm familiar domain enough busi softwar engin never familiar domain domain expert provid platform radic fast develop end may also product withhold 2 3 year evolut need scale even need prematur optim <p> also use rail qualiti level set high need ton librari need fast node qualiti level librari much wors seen node enough time seen first half year node number qualiti librari npm modul probabl sever magnitud order less rubi gem world go need wait 4 year get level divers qualiti set compar way <p> use rubi care slow client system-level work <p> given time keep option use jrubi compar mri normal c implement rubi perform better consider number criteria imho dynamicinvok jvm game changer term peopl consid jrubi groovi scala <p> use node js know domain remain small non-complex i'll deal slow client real user <p> top backend system turn thin api server chanc twitter roll back spa bring back server side templat render number problem get move logic render client requir huge blog post i'll probabl make one day peopl awar never came full-fledg enterpris level desktop app use design cad pretti familiar complex client-sid architectur mani dragon i'm happi live server side thing much predict <p> rail die neither rubi advent progress jvm jrubi never whole discuss remind java die scala came around java die oracl came around guess go read java 8 <p> tldr use i'd recommend anyon would server-sid never thin api rubi rail die least sword thing one might want work good foundat intuit use <p> @jondot,0.07134168212739639,0.44175510204081636

2012-03-26 17:11:32,"A few months ago I was making plans for what is now my home base website for App Store &#38; other projects. I'd been working in obj-c for about 2 years both on the Mac and on iOS, but also had a fair bit of python experience with Django, App Engine, etc. I decided to give it a shot with obj-c.<p>I knew about the handful of ""big"" frameworks for handling this task with obj-c, but rejected them in favor of getting more hands-on experience building it, pushing myself and learning in the process. It was, of course, a personal project, something I alone was responsible for working with, so I decided it was OK if I experimented a little.<p>I went into the project knowing I would eventually have to port it to Python (and I did), but it was a lot of fun :)<p>I hand picked some lightweight libraries to handle specific parts of the server. One has to be cautious knowing that a library developer who thinks their sole target is a tiny cellphone, may not be worrying about things you will eventually have to worry about on a server.<p>I picked CocoaHTTPServer to handle requests and responses, and someone else had written a nicer ""route"" style interface for it which meant all of the possible responses to an http request were simply a series of blocks defined in a row, each with a regex or named parameter style URL route defined right there next to the code that would handle it. This works out to be quite a similar layout in code as something like Bottle/Python or Express/Node.js, both of which I've worked with now and I very much prefer this style.<p>I made good use of blocks &#38; dispatch queues elsewhere as well, firing off an async block whenever I needed to pull new tweets from Twitter's api, or update Github repo stats (both are cached and displayed on the site).<p>I picked a Mustache template library and a Markdown parser library I found on Github for handling dynamic page generation &#38; blog post syntax, respectively. Sqlite for storing anything that needed to be stored, Regexkit-lite for properly checking and handling anything that may be passed in to a url query or post body, etc.<p>I changed the Xcode project type to build me an executable binary that lived inside a bundle (Server.bundle) containing all the pages and assets the thing needed, so it could be deployed as a single ""thing"".<p>I also got Lion's sandboxing to work quite easily, which in theory would give some moderate protection against the entire server being compromised if someone managed to get an exploit to run inside the process.<p>Other than some CPU usage issues with the template library (easily solved by nginx caching pages), it all worked really, really well. I threw enough abuse at it, and did enough debugging that I was confident it would hold up well in production (which turned out to be wrong).<p>And then it came time to deploy somewhere, a problem I had been working on since day one, so i knew what i was getting in to.<p>There were only a few options: a cross-compiler framework like Cocotron (compile on Mac, run on Linux), one of the native *step libraries like GNUstep running on Linux or FreeBSD, or simply deploy on a Mac somewhere.<p>I tried all combinations other than Mac first, I built out a GNUstep environment with libobjc2 on FreeBSD, tried the cocotron-&#62;linux stuff, each time watching something blow up in my face due to my choice of components and my requirements.<p>While obj-c is cross platform, some of the libraries and features I chose to use were not. CocoaHTTPServer is built on top of CFNetwork, which is not part of any obj-c framework/library, but rather a lower level Apple C library only found on Macs. There's a ""lite"" open source version, but I quickly discovered that solving one issue like that would only bring up another. For instance, dispatch blocks will only work with GNUstep at the moment, and only when it is compiled with clang, against libobjc2, a combination few if any Linux distros actually ship in their repos.<p>Not a lot of people interested in deploying modern, dispatch/block-heavy, obj-c 2.0 code to Linux, not nearly as many as there are deploying such things to OS X or iOS.<p>So I decided why not just run on a Mac server somewhere? After all I can't solve every problem all at the same time, and on a Mac a lot of those problems were non-existent, plus the Mac approach would allow me to use things only available on a Mac, like easy sandboxing and potentially keychain integration for auth.<p>I found a Mac VPS provider that ran Xserves and hosted copies of Lion server inside VMware (HostMyApple, not someone fudging the licensing in moms basement). It worked really, really well, as long as I treated it like a headless server (issues with Lion Server are another story for another time). My sandboxing worked, performance was fantastic aside from the CPU usage during a cache miss, so I was fairly happy.<p>Long story short though, memory leaks in 3rd party libraries (that only someone running a server would likely hit), coupled with higher hosting costs (and fewer choices), smaller community and a desire to use some things that are really only ""mature"" in other languages (database adapters, etc), caused me to spend a few days porting the entire thing to Python.<p>My site now runs on a Linode, and is a nearly identical clone of the obj-c version, ported as a Python/Bottle app. There was nothing particularly wrong with the obj-c approach, but the primary focus of nearly all obj-c developers and libraries is iOS, where processes never live longer than a few minutes, or Mac where a crash or leak is only going to affect one person rather than a few hundred in-flight requests. I expect if I had stuck with one of the ""frameworks"" intended for this purpose it would have been a viable option but as I said before I wasn't looking for turn-key, but wanting to get my hands dirty :)",Twitter,"month ago make plan home base websit app store #38 project i'd work obj-c 2 year mac io also fair bit python experi django app engin etc decid give shot obj-c <p> knew hand big framework handl task obj-c reject favor get hands-on experi build push learn process cours person project someth alon respons work decid ok experi littl <p> went project know would eventu port python lot fun :) <p> hand pick lightweight librari handl specif part server one cautiou know librari develop think sole target tini cellphon may worri thing eventu worri server <p> pick cocoahttpserv handl request respons someon els written nicer rout style interfac meant possibl respons http request simpli seri block defin row regex name paramet style url rout defin right next code would handl work quit similar layout code someth like bottl python express node js i'v work much prefer style <p> made good use block #38 dispatch queue elsewher well fire async block whenev need pull new tweet twitter' api updat github repo stat cach display site <p> pick mustach templat librari markdown parser librari found github handl dynam page gener #38 blog post syntax respect sqlite store anyth need store regexkit-lit properli check handl anyth may pass url queri post bodi etc <p> chang xcode project type build execut binari live insid bundl server bundl contain page asset thing need could deploy singl thing <p> also got lion' sandbox work quit easili theori would give moder protect entir server compromis someon manag get exploit run insid process <p> cpu usag issu templat librari easili solv nginx cach page work realli realli well threw enough abus enough debug confid would hold well product turn wrong <p> came time deploy somewher problem work sinc day one knew get <p> option cross-compil framework like cocotron compil mac run linux one nativ step librari like gnustep run linux freebsd simpli deploy mac somewher <p> tri combin mac first built gnustep environ libobjc 2 freebsd tri cocotron #62 linux stuff time watch someth blow face due choic compon requir <p> obj-c cross platform librari featur chose use cocoahttpserv built top cfnetwork part obj-c framework librari rather lower level appl c librari found mac there' lite open sourc version quickli discov solv one issu like would bring anoth instanc dispatch block work gnustep moment compil clang libobjc 2, combin linux distro actual ship repo <p> lot peopl interest deploy modern dispatch block-heavi obj-c 2.0 code linux nearli mani deploy thing os x io <p> decid run mac server somewher can't solv everi problem time mac lot problem non-exist plu mac approach would allow use thing avail mac like easi sandbox potenti keychain integr auth <p> found mac vp provid ran xserv host copi lion server insid vmware hostmyappl someon fudg licens mom basement work realli realli well long treat like headless server issu lion server anoth stori anoth time sandbox work perform fantast asid cpu usag cach miss fairli happi <p> long stori short though memori leak 3 rd parti librari someon run server would like hit coupl higher host cost fewer choic smaller commun desir use thing realli matur languag databas adapt etc caus spend day port entir thing python <p> site run linod nearli ident clone obj-c version port python bottl app noth particularli wrong obj-c approach primari focu nearli obj-c develop librari io process never live longer minut mac crash leak go affect one person rather hundr in-flight request expect stuck one framework intend purpos would viabl option said look turn-key want get hand dirti :)",0.09578936688311689,0.47339353354978364

This unique plugin is authorized to request keys for messages for your Trusted Contacts and generate new keys associated with your account.<p>The keys are generated in parallel on the client and on the key management server. They are always rolling forward and are synced in real-time with some unique variables within your custom plugin.<p>No two messages are encrypted with the same key and are only stored in memory during the encryption / decryption process. Every time a message or photo that has been protected is viewed by yourself or others authorization to that messages key is requested.<p>Your Trusted Contact list is managed globally by connecting with other users through Social Fortress. Within Facebook all of your friends are initially treated as Trusted Contacts and you can easily remove individuals from this list with the click of a button.<p>Social Fortress uses AES-256 CTR for the encryption and communicates over a 256 SSL stream from your device to the key management server. The data in this stream is also encrypted using aspects of your customized installation.<p>The technology for web services (Facebook, Google+) operates as browser plugin for Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer (not publicly available right now) and independent of any service's API.<p>The technology for Thunderbird and Outlook is a separate plugin which requires installation.<p>We integrate transparently into the products we support so the user experience is exactly the same. No extra clicks, no confusing decisions and nothing extra to learn. We designed Social Fortress to be used by individuals who don't even know what the word encryption is.<p>Within every environment you have the ability to enable / disable Social Fortress protection with the click of a button or using a keyboard shortcut (CTRL+Q). This only disables the encryption functions. The reader is always on so you can use Social Fortress just to view your friends protected content without having to protect your own. It's like having Flash or PDF Reader once it is installed you don't ever have to do anything again.<p>If your device becomes compromised / lost / whatever you can login to the site and disable all active installations in two clicks and this will not affect previously encrypted messages and we just disable authorization access to your old plugins and have no need to change any previously generated keys.<p>We also support other services but have yet to make them live:<p>Skype Chat, Twitter, mail.yahoo.com, Gmail.com, Chatter.com, Yammer.com, Blackberry Native Email support",Twitter,social fortress current provid transpar client-sid encrypt decrypt within facebook googl thunderbird outlook messag photo <p> download instal social fortress plugin custom sync account key manag server uniqu plugin author request key messag trust contact gener new key associ account <p> key gener parallel client key manag server alway roll forward sync real-tim uniqu variabl within custom plugin <p> two messag encrypt key store memori encrypt decrypt process everi time messag photo protect view other author messag key request <p> trust contact list manag global connect user social fortress within facebook friend initi treat trust contact easili remov individu list click button <p> social fortress use ae 256 ctr encrypt commun 256 ssl stream devic key manag server data stream also encrypt use aspect custom instal <p> technolog web servic facebook googl oper browser plugin firefox chrome internet explor publicli avail right independ service' api <p> technolog thunderbird outlook separ plugin requir instal <p> integr transpar product support user experi exactli extra click confus decis noth extra learn design social fortress use individu even know word encrypt <p> within everi environ abil enabl disabl social fortress protect click button use keyboard shortcut ctrl q disabl encrypt function reader alway use social fortress view friend protect content without protect like flash pdf reader instal ever anyth <p> devic becom compromis lost whatev login site disabl activ instal two click affect previous encrypt messag disabl author access old plugin need chang previous gener key <p> also support servic yet make live <p> skype chat twitter mail yahoo com gmail com chatter com yammer com blackberri nativ email support,0.015480055658627086,0.4451878478664192

However, there isn't enough of it. when I click one of the items in the cycling list of features, then I expect a new page or a significant amount of extra detail 'below the fold' - not a stock photo with a one-line explanation of a concept that is already self-explanatory to anyone working in the industry.<p>there are other features that I want that I don't see, which are increasingly important to ADs.

FD can generate breakdown lists, and being able to import these will reduce the work needed for breakdown by 80-90%.<p>o screenplay/breakdown versioning - on large projects, changes in shooting order or rewritten scenes are the norm. Assume they will occur and make sure the process of 'forking' is as easy as possible.<p>o Storyboards. I can't believe you don't have 2-way integration of location scouting and breakdown with mobile cameras.<p>o export to media/printing - in a remote location, you cannot safely assume access to the internet, cloud, or universal availability of smartphones or internet-capable devices among the cast and crew. You will still need to be able to produce sides and fall back on more primitive methods. On long nights in the middle of nowhere with terrible weather, paper, pencil and flashlight are going to be around for a while yet. When it comes to charging electronic devices, cameras and sound recorders are going to take priority over ipads and cellphones.<p>o allow for retroactive changes to be made under the cirucmstances described above; sometimes a weary crew will come back to base camp with a list of necessary changes that are handed to a confused production manager, and which must be entered correctly for the following days' shooting schedule to work.<p>o contact management - naturally you want to have that information centralized, but nobody likes having to enter everybody's contact details into a yet another database program with yet another set of misspellings, incorrect phone numbers, yadda yadda. Allow contact import from GMail, Facebook, google+ hotmail, and other major providers. Allow the creation of a contact address that automatically harvests email information and builds the mailing list. Provide call sheets that include hyperlinks and/or graphical maps leveraging some popular mapping API. Use email, Twilio, Twitter, checkin and location services to automagically alert and monitor call times, navigation planning, ride-sharing, and general logistics.<p>o Ensure that the logistical functionality also applies to location/prop management, gear rental, suppliers and so forth.<p>o Include templates for model, location and service releases and allow for digital signature and post-production hard-copy transmission to reduce presale clearance issues. Releases matter, but to so few people on set that they are frequently overlooked during production, leading to expensive headaches later. The closer to sale or release, the more expensive the headache.<p>o Pre/post breakdowns - breakdowns are such a hassle that they are often prepared only for production, while project management before and after principal photography is often done on the back of an envelope. Get pro with this from the outset. Which also means...<p>o input for shooting logs from the AC/Sound team<p>o digital slating - again, this should be out front - scene/shot # and shot clock on an iPad or Android tablet are a no-brainer, and a key visual sell for your branding. A major missed opportunity in your existing design.<p>o Not to mention GPS on mobile devices. Don't just do an electronic implementation of what's already on paper or a laptop and then make people manually add information from digital sensors.<p>o Hell, start planning now for being an input vector for video/audio recording. I have posted audio that was recorded on an iPod because the director suddenly got inspired while he was having coffee with one of the actors and had the means of production in his pocket.<p>o Platform agnosticism - although Apple dominates in the film world, it is by no means universal. Don't confine yourself to a single platform, especially when 95% of your functionality can be achieved with html, css, and node.js.<p>o Build marketing in from the getgo. Eastwood should also be the tool of choice for image tagging tagging, media assets, managing a social media, and driving your marketing campaign from pre-production onwards using the most enthusiastic and committed members of your team - your cast and crew, who stand to benefit directly from the film's success. You'll also need to coordinate their availability for post-production, sales, and release phases, from wrap parties to reshoots to private screenings.<p>o I'm not 100% sure about your branding; the name 'Eastwood' is very clever but might be misinterpreted as implying the authorship or endorsement of a certain Famous Actor...who has more money, fans, and legal experience than your whole team put together. If I were your lawyer, which I am not and which I could not be because I am not a lawyer, then I would advise against infringing on Clint Eastwood's right of publicity because that would basically require you to give him a Large Amount of Money or ownership of the company in lieu.

I waited almost a year longer than expected to get my unit. Because I just wanted to tinker I wasn't bothered. Ninja Blocks say their units are manufactured, just waiting for the enclosures. This might not be a problem for them.<p>-- Battery eaters --
Twine eats batteries like nobodies business. Two AA batteries last about two weeks. On the forums this seems like the typical experience. Ninja Blocks looks as if the central 'Ninja Block' can be mains powered. But will the wireless sensors have a short battery life?<p>-- Web app --
Twine has a website that the device must communicate with to report data and push rules to it. There's no (out-of-the-box) way to get it to talk to a local server via a clean API.<p>This was a big disappointment for me mainly because their web app is very limited:
- No data logging (just reports the latest figure)
- Rules can just be triggered over thresholds (ie when temperature reaches 20c then X) not when temperature changes
- For moisture the actual resistance isn't reported, just a wet or dry condition. This renders it useless for plant watering.<p>Twine can make a HTTP request when a rule is tripped. I plan to play with this but it's not that useful if it can't just HTTP request every time a value changes as I wanted to log temperature (plus it's a GET!).<p>The Ninja Blocks apps look better and appear to fill the gap between reading something then doing something. Twine can really only report something (twitter/sms/email/HTTP supported). But I'd caution that until you get your hands a device like this you don't know of its true limitations.<p>-- Sensors --
I didn't up my kickstarter amount when they announced new sensors. I wish I had, as only the temperature sensor is nearly useful. The other built in sensor is orientation... ? IMHO they should've thrown in the other sensors and maybe upped the price to increase satisfaction.<p>I prefer the sensor pack that ships by default with Ninja Blocks.<p>In spite of the above I'm optimistic about Twine as it really is early days. This space has massive potential if it can break out of communities like ours into the mainstream. I just hope Supermechanical doesn't get distracted and focusses squarely on their flagship product.<p>Ninja Blocks?

I didn't think the site would recover from that.<p>The hardest part was to scale it economically. I have always been a big fan of SSD's, which are instrumental in scaling a site that doesn't have the resources to put data they need fast access to in RAM. For example, a site with more money might use redis to cache all the pics for each user (sorted, unique lists), plus all the tweets that point to a pic, but there is too much for me to do that in RAM without selling organs. Also, redis is not very memory efficient. But the advantage is that technologies like that are easy to use and easy to scale.

Will they remove pics from the streaming API? I doubt it. Will they make moves to single me out? That would be weird. Will they come after me with lawyers for caching tweets? I don't see that either.

2012-11-17 23:13:19,"The issue is one of lock-in.  I think that we here on HN are a reasonable bunch.  It's why I like this community.  We don't begrudge our local pizza place earning profit off of us for providing us with a service.  Similarly, we don't mind people in our own industry earning profit in exchange for a service.<p>However, when a business involves network effects, the morality changes.  If WordPress.com started charging exorbitant fees, cutting off functionality, or putting annoying ads everywhere, I could simply move my blog to any number of other hosts or self-host it and none of my readers would be any the wiser.  However, Twitter grew because it offered this liberal, API-driven architecture that allowed tools to flourish and whatnot.  Now, we're feeling like we're in a bait-and-switch moment and we can't leave because our followers have followed us on Twitter.  If we left, we could no longer connect with them.  We're stuck and unless Twitter does something so crappy that we're willing to start over, we have to live with it.<p>Heck, if Twitter was like this from the beginning, would a competitor have gotten the growth that we gave Twitter?  Let's say that Twitter and Jaiku committed to a 15-year feature set as part of a community promise in 2006.  Twitter told us as users and prospective users (before we built large follower networks) that they were going to shut down third party access and plaster ads over the feeds while Jaiku told us that they would commit to ensuring third party access, but might run ads.  Would we have looked at Twitter and Jaiku and given Jaiku the growth and network?<p>I know it's unreasonable to ask a company to commit to a 15 year feature set.  I'm not suggesting that we have any rights to force Twitter to act how we deem proper.  However, when a company creates a lock-in system (like Twitter does with followers) and they perform a bait-and-switch, I think we do have the right to be mildly annoyed and to point out that this might not be the most moral way of acting.<p>Lock-in allows companies to act against their users in a way we should be against.  That doesn't mean we're against profit.  For example, there was a pizza place near me that offered a large cheese pizza for $5.  It wasn't especially good pizza, but it was $5 and my roommate and I loved it for that.  Later, they raised the price to $7.80 (IIRC).  I assume it wasn't so profitable at $5.  However, at nearly $8, we felt we'd rather pay an additional couple dollars to get better pizza.  We didn't begrudge the store their price hike.  We didn't feel they owed us cheap pizza.  Why?  Because they held no power over us.  We could re-make our decision as things changed.<p>For those of us using Twitter, we can't re-make that decision.  Twitter got some of us to use their service because of things they're now taking away.  Maybe other competitors would have had more traction if Twitter acted this way from the start.  But they locked us in and then acted in a way inconsistent to what got them the lock-in.  That's bad.  It isn't take to the streets bad.  It isn't quit the service bad.  But it is bad enough to blog and/or comment about.<p>The issue isn't that we want to deny Twitter the ability to profit.  The issue is that Twitter locked us in and now we feel like we don't have other options for that style of communication.  Twitter has become a sort-of monopoly over that type of communication and they might start using that monopoly power not to merely become profitable, but to become more profitable than a competitive market would allow - at our expense.<p>In some ways, it's tough to be a monopolist.  Everyone gets to take shots at you.  In a competitive market, people generally don't take shots so much because they don't care: they'll just move along to something else that makes them happy.  Twitter's changes are making some people unhappy.  Maybe no other service could be profitable doing less - that is entirely possible. It's entirely possible that Twitter is being as awesome as possible and that they're nearly saintly in their devotion to their users needs - as much as is humanly and technologically possible.  However, we don't and won't know that because of Twitter's lock-in and because of that lock-in, these changes might not feel like Twitter trying to merely continue along and earn a modest profit for its investors, but an exercise of power over us.  That sounds more dramatic than I meant it to.  I mean, it's Twitter, not the heart surgery that someone needs.  Still, it's annoying when we feel someone isn't dealing with us in a square way.  When there are loads of competitors, we can say ""well, it just costs about that much to get me a pizza.""  When there's only one competitor, we become less forgiving because monopoly power has been levied against us in the past to our detriment.  There are loads of alternatives to 37signals' products.  There are loads of alternatives to WordPress.com.  There are loads of other local pizza places.

2012-11-13 13:41:40,"&#62; K&#38;R than GoF.<p>Very different comparison to the patterns Fowler presented. The patterns GoF presented were very basic, and were interesting <i>then</i> with languages like C++ when people were still fucking up many of the basic patterns. The number of horribly broken C++ Singleton implementations I've seen, for example, beggars belief. Today that's less of an issue.<p>The patterns Fowler presents are, as the title says, about architecture not low level implementation, and they are patterns you will tend to find in pretty much any large software project today yet that people still manage to fuck up royally, which is the reason the patterns matter.<p>Patters are nothing but recipes of best practice. They're not meant to be ""intriguing"" once you understand the tradeoffs. They're meant to become boring and bland and trivial once people are comfortable with them and their implementation is well understood. They're also meant to give people a shared vocabulary for talking about it. That's the <i>entire</i> <i>point</i>.<p>Most of the patterns in EAR are nowhere that for most people, judging by the code I see regularly and judging by how there's still this cargo cult around the AR pattern by people who in many cases have not even heard about the other ORM patterns presented by Fowler, much less other alternatives.<p>&#62;  There is limited time and large number of books - one has to be picky.<p>If I were to pick <i>any</i> book on software development from the last 10-15 years I'd like everyone to read, it'd be Enterprise Software Architecture, for a simple reason: I still see people using those patterns every day, yet screwing them up in horrible ways. Maybe you don't need it, but the developers I come across for the most part sure do.<p>&#62; Person.where(""last_name = ?"", last_name) is the most concise way to issue that query. Abstracting last_name so that if the field name changes, the query still is relevant is overkill.<p>That is only true if you're dealing with a query that simple (even then, the ""Rails way"" of doing your example would be Person.find_by_lastname(lastname)). On the other hand, I've read the code of dozens of Rails apps that contains several lines long SQL queries littered just because they could.<p>The biggest problem in <i>your</i> example as why you are asking for persons with specific last names in the first place. 9/10 when I see code like that, it is the wrong (too low level) question, and leaks domain logic that should be confined to the model.<p>Also, what happens when you need to serve that query from a web API instead of your database? From a full text engine? From file? From a noSQL database? From on disk hash table? I've had to do all of these - often several from the same application. With a suitable architecture you just plug in your new storage and implement the finders you need supported, and won't have to play ""hunt the raw SQL"". Changing column names is the least of my concerns - that can be fixed with a simple search replace.<p>You also miss the point when you say you can do a base model class and do a mapper yourself: The point is the architecture of AR makes leaking SQL which often ends up in controllers and other places they don't belong all over the place the easy default, while implementing cleaner abstractions is more work.<p>The end result is that most places where AR is used end up with high degrees of coupling for no good reason.<p>If everyone used AR in a disciplined way and avoided littering their controllers and other code with query details that belongs in their models, there wouldn't be a problem.<p>Your argument reminds me of the old memory-protection vs. no memory-protection in the 80's, where the Amiga camp for example tended to be bitterly against memory protection because it was seen as expensive, slow and enabling lazy developers. Expecting developers to write clean code with ActiveRecord is a bit similar to expecting developers to write code free of bad memory accesses without memory protection - it makes it far too easy to do the wrong thing.<p>&#62; github, twitter, heroku et al would like to disagree.<p>And Ebay at least used to be written using ISAPI modules, and large parts of Yahoo runs or used to run on a horrific mess of PHP and Perl (I used to work at Yahoo; there was a lot of dreadful code). Your point again?<p>(and Twitter is a particularly bad example given how much time they spend moaning about how they've needed to move most stuff off Ruby)<p>Besides, pointing to web startups as the pinnacle of engineering quality is ridiculous at best of times - while some of what happens in web startups is amazing, there are also plenty of areas where we're still lagging 20 years behind engineering practices in the enterprise space. Active Record was not by any means a <i>new</i> pattern, for example - none of the patterns in EAR were. They were Fowler's cataloguing of well established patterns with years of use in industry.<p>Rails, and AR, is still better than a lot of the alternatives. That does not mean there are not better ways for a lot of uses than resorting to AR.<p>&#62; Person.where(""last_name = ?"", last_name) makes it unsuitable for large projects?<p>Strawman. If you think simple cases like that is what it is about, you've not seen much complicated Rails code, and it's a waste having this discussion with you.<p>&#62;  It has been long enough to call it time tested.<p>So is BASIC. That doesn't mean it's good. ""Time tested"" is not in itself an argument for anything.<p>&#62;  If Person.where(""last_name = ?"", last_name) is not abstract enough and makes it unsuitable for your projects(still the only concrete complaint from you), look for alternatives.<p>I don't use AR the library unless I absolutely have to, which means I only use it if I help out on Rails projects where I can't dictate policy. Otherwise I'll generally use Sequel, which though it suffers from many similar flaws drawn in large part to inspiration from AR, is cleaner in many ways. There's many things I'd love to change about it, but I already have at twice as much stuff to do as I should.<p>For small projects I might use the Sequel schema module which implements the AR <i>pattern</i>, and which allows for a lot of the same crap that people do with AR the library, but still makes it a lot easier to avoid raw SQL. The AR pattern has its place.<p>But for larger projects I'd generally be inclined to implement mappers, then often with Sequel (<i>without</i> the schema/model module) used internally by the mappers only.",Twitter,#62 k #38 r gof <p> differ comparison pattern fowler present pattern gof present basic interest <i> </i> languag like c peopl still fuck mani basic pattern number horribl broken c singleton implement i'v seen exampl beggar belief today that' less issu <p> pattern fowler present titl say architectur low level implement pattern tend find pretti much larg softwar project today yet peopl still manag fuck royal reason pattern matter <p> patter noth recip best practic they'r meant intrigu understand tradeoff they'r meant becom bore bland trivial peopl comfort implement well understood they'r also meant give peopl share vocabulari talk that' <i> entir </i> <i> point </i> <p> pattern ear nowher peopl judg code see regularli judg there' still cargo cult around ar pattern peopl mani case even heard orm pattern present fowler much less altern <p> #62 limit time larg number book one picki <p> pick <i> </i> book softwar develop last 10 15 year i'd like everyon read it'd enterpris softwar architectur simpl reason still see peopl use pattern everi day yet screw horribl way mayb need develop come across part sure <p> #62 person last_nam last_nam concis way issu queri abstract last_nam field name chang queri still relev overkil <p> true deal queri simpl even rail way exampl would person find_by_lastnam lastnam hand i'v read code dozen rail app contain sever line long sql queri litter could <p> biggest problem <i> </i> exampl ask person specif last name first place 9 10 see code like wrong low level question leak domain logic confin model <p> also happen need serv queri web api instead databas full text engin file nosql databas disk hash tabl i'v often sever applic suitabl architectur plug new storag implement finder need support play hunt raw sql chang column name least concern fix simpl search replac <p> also miss point say base model class mapper point architectur ar make leak sql often end control place belong place easi default implement cleaner abstract work <p> end result place ar use end high degre coupl good reason <p> everyon use ar disciplin way avoid litter control code queri detail belong model problem <p> argument remind old memory-protect vs memory-protect 80 amiga camp exampl tend bitterli memori protect seen expens slow enabl lazi develop expect develop write clean code activerecord bit similar expect develop write code free bad memori access without memori protect make far easi wrong thing <p> #62 github twitter heroku et al would like disagre <p> ebay least use written use isapi modul larg part yahoo run use run horrif mess php perl use work yahoo lot dread code point <p> twitter particularli bad exampl given much time spend moan they'v need move stuff rubi <p> besid point web startup pinnacl engin qualiti ridicul best time happen web startup amaz also plenti area we'r still lag 20 year behind engin practic enterpris space activ record mean <i> new </i> pattern exampl none pattern ear fowler' catalogu well establish pattern year use industri <p> rail ar still better lot altern mean better way lot use resort ar <p> #62 person last_nam last_nam make unsuit larg project <p> strawman think simpl case like seen much complic rail code wast discuss <p> #62 long enough call time test <p> basic mean good time test argument anyth <p> #62 person last_nam last_nam abstract enough make unsuit project still concret complaint look altern <p> use ar librari unless absolut mean use help rail project can't dictat polici otherwis i'll gener use sequel though suffer mani similar flaw drawn larg part inspir ar cleaner mani way there' mani thing i'd love chang alreadi twice much stuff <p> small project might use sequel schema modul implement ar <i> pattern </i> allow lot crap peopl ar librari still make lot easier avoid raw sql ar pattern place <p> larger project i'd gener inclin implement mapper often sequel <i> without </i> schema model modul use intern mapper,-0.01518683880222342,0.4435034367342059

The hard part is scaling your centralized database.  Considering most people using PHP are writing applications backed by a single SQL database, it's a bit disingenuous to call the language ""shared nothing"".  While true, it's completely meaningless and true of literally every programming language ever.<p>It's like saying, ""English makes it really easy to tell love stories.""<p><i>I wont need experts  If the event that my new ventures grow and I need to hire on more programmers I do not need the best and brightest to get the job done.</i><p>True of any language.  I can hire people that are bad at programming any language, cheaply.<p>The deeper problem is that PHP makes it tough to multiply effort by creating good abstractions, so there is a lot of repetitive grunt-work that's best outsourced to a country where people are happy making five bucks an hour.<p><i>It is tied to the web</i><p>""PHP doesn't work very well when not serving web pages, so I use it to serve web pages.""  The tautology department called, they want their tautology department back.<p><i>When it fails, it doesnt fail hard</i><p>I am not sure what this means.  Each request is handled by a single UNIX process.  That's, again, how the author happens to architect applications, not an intrinsic (or unique) property of PHP.<p><i>Other languages need a lot of plumbing to handle that.</i><p>Citation needed.  This is standard CGI that's been around since the 80s.<p><i>There are a plethora of frameworks to chose from</i><p>That's fine.  Again true of any language.  Even Common Frickin' Lisp has several frameworks.<p><i>Best documentation on the web</i><p>The author does not explain why, only that he wishes he could log in with his Twitter account to propose changes.  (What ever happened to emailing the author?)<p><i>Tons of blogs</i><p>True of everything, from programming languages to pictures of cats.<p><i>The PHP Community</i><p>True of pretty much every language I've ever encountered.  Even C.<p>I like the Perl community best because of the infrastructure that the members build for each other.  Want to get an email when your module's tests fail on HP-UX?  Someone has built a service for that.<p>Answering questions is nice, but that's the tip of the community iceberg.<p><i>It integrates with everything</i><p>I read this as: ""PHP has a socket API.""<p><i>Dynamic typing</i><p>I'm just going to quote this one verbatim because I can't come up with anything more hilarious:<p><i>But how do you know if youre working with an int or a string?  By using your brain.  HTTP does not do typing and so PHP does not do (strong) typing for scalars.  Quite frankly, it makes complete sense to do it that way.  Want an int?  Cast the damn thing and stop complaining.  Dynamic typing significantly reduces the amount of code you need to write and error conditions you need to check for.
It plain works  Programmers have it wrong.  The technical solution is not the end goal.  Technology should be an enabler.  Do you have a wonderful technical solution that doesnt solve a problem?  Bye, bye.  PHP solves problems faster, easier and with a lower cost of ownership than almost anything out there.  A lot of that is based on assumptions (or shortcuts) that PHP takes to solve a problem.  Most often those shortcuts work, and the workarounds are very easy to implement (Im thinking mainly about strict type checking here).</i><p>Little does the author know that you can have dynamic typing in any statically-typed language:<p><pre><code>   /** Immutable scalar value. */
   public final class Scalar {

       private final Integer intValue;  // not int so that ""null"" is meaningful
       private final String stringValue;

       public Scalar(String string) {
           stringValue = string;
       }

       public Scalar(int i) {
           intValue = new Integer(i);
       }

       public String toString() {
           if (stringValue == null) {
               fixupString();
           }
           return stringValue;
       }

       public int toInt() {
           if (intValue == null) {
               fixupInteger();
           }
           return intValue.intValue();
       }

       private void fixupString() {
           stringValue = intValue.toString();

       private void fixupInteger() {

All PHP adds are operators like + that are typed Scalar -&#62; Scalar instead of Number -&#62; Number, making up arbitrary behavior for non-numeric values.  If you wanted dynamic typing in Java, you would just write a special math library over your Scalar type and write your application in terms of those operations instead of the built-in ones.  The reason nobody does that is because the static typing, though verbose, makes for nice self-documentation.<p>At some point you need to decide on a type for a value and most people try to do that as soon as possible.  When I write in a dynamically typed language that's not Python, I usually assert well-formedness immediately after reading the data from outside my program.  At that point, dynamic typing is a <i>loss</i> in safety to me.   (When I write Python, I never explicitly check types and let mistyped operations fail at runtime, because that's the convention.)<p>Anyway, that was a fun article.",Twitter,love x reason point-by-point rebutt fun write go <p> <i> php stupid easi scale </i> <p> everi program languag hard part scale central databas consid peopl use php write applic back singl sql databas bit disingenu call languag share noth true complet meaningless true liter everi program languag ever <p> like say english make realli easi tell love stori <p> <i> wont need expert event new ventur grow need hire programm need best brightest get job done </i> <p> true languag hire peopl bad program languag cheapli <p> deeper problem php make tough multipli effort creat good abstract lot repetit grunt-work that' best outsourc countri peopl happi make five buck hour <p> <i> tie web </i> <p> php work well serv web page use serv web page tautolog depart call want tautolog depart back <p> <i> fail doesnt fail hard </i> <p> sure mean request handl singl unix process that' author happen architect applic intrins uniqu properti php <p> <i> languag need lot plumb handl </i> <p> citat need standard cgi that' around sinc 80 <p> <i> plethora framework chose </i> <p> that' fine true languag even common frickin lisp sever framework <p> <i> best document web </i> <p> author explain wish could log twitter account propos chang ever happen email author <p> <i> ton blog </i> <p> true everyth program languag pictur cat <p> <i> php commun </i> <p> true pretti much everi languag i'v ever encount even c <p> like perl commun best infrastructur member build want get email module' test fail hp-ux someon built servic <p> answer question nice that' tip commun iceberg <p> <i> integr everyth </i> <p> read php socket api <p> <i> dynam type </i> <p> i'm go quot one verbatim can't come anyth hilari <p> <i> know your work int string use brain http type php strong type scalar quit frankli make complet sens way want int cast damn thing stop complain dynam type significantli reduc amount code need write error condit need check plain work programm wrong technic solut end goal technolog enabl wonder technic solut doesnt solv problem bye bye php solv problem faster easier lower cost ownership almost anyth lot base assumpt shortcut php take solv problem often shortcut work workaround easi implement im think mainli strict type check </i> <p> littl author know dynam type statically-typ languag <p> <pre> <code> immut scalar valu public final class scalar privat final integ intvalu int null meaning privat final string stringvalu public scalar string string stringvalu string public scalar int intvalu new integ public string tostr stringvalu null fixupstr return stringvalu public int toint intvalu null fixupinteg return intvalu intvalu privat void fixupstr stringvalu intvalu tostr privat void fixupinteg intvalu integ parseint stringvalu </code> </pre> php add oper like type scalar #62 scalar instead number #62 number make arbitrari behavior non-numer valu want dynam type java would write special math librari scalar type write applic term oper instead built-in one reason nobodi static type though verbos make nice self-document <p> point need decid type valu peopl tri soon possibl write dynam type languag that' python usual assert well-formed immedi read data outsid program point dynam type <i> loss </i> safeti write python never explicitli check type let mistyp oper fail runtim that' convent <p> anyway fun articl,0.09131226284004061,0.5011861338250228

2012-03-26 17:11:32,"A few months ago I was making plans for what is now my home base website for App Store &#38; other projects. I'd been working in obj-c for about 2 years both on the Mac and on iOS, but also had a fair bit of python experience with Django, App Engine, etc. I decided to give it a shot with obj-c.<p>I knew about the handful of ""big"" frameworks for handling this task with obj-c, but rejected them in favor of getting more hands-on experience building it, pushing myself and learning in the process. It was, of course, a personal project, something I alone was responsible for working with, so I decided it was OK if I experimented a little.<p>I went into the project knowing I would eventually have to port it to Python (and I did), but it was a lot of fun :)<p>I hand picked some lightweight libraries to handle specific parts of the server. One has to be cautious knowing that a library developer who thinks their sole target is a tiny cellphone, may not be worrying about things you will eventually have to worry about on a server.<p>I picked CocoaHTTPServer to handle requests and responses, and someone else had written a nicer ""route"" style interface for it which meant all of the possible responses to an http request were simply a series of blocks defined in a row, each with a regex or named parameter style URL route defined right there next to the code that would handle it. This works out to be quite a similar layout in code as something like Bottle/Python or Express/Node.js, both of which I've worked with now and I very much prefer this style.<p>I made good use of blocks &#38; dispatch queues elsewhere as well, firing off an async block whenever I needed to pull new tweets from Twitter's api, or update Github repo stats (both are cached and displayed on the site).<p>I picked a Mustache template library and a Markdown parser library I found on Github for handling dynamic page generation &#38; blog post syntax, respectively. Sqlite for storing anything that needed to be stored, Regexkit-lite for properly checking and handling anything that may be passed in to a url query or post body, etc.<p>I changed the Xcode project type to build me an executable binary that lived inside a bundle (Server.bundle) containing all the pages and assets the thing needed, so it could be deployed as a single ""thing"".<p>I also got Lion's sandboxing to work quite easily, which in theory would give some moderate protection against the entire server being compromised if someone managed to get an exploit to run inside the process.<p>Other than some CPU usage issues with the template library (easily solved by nginx caching pages), it all worked really, really well. I threw enough abuse at it, and did enough debugging that I was confident it would hold up well in production (which turned out to be wrong).<p>And then it came time to deploy somewhere, a problem I had been working on since day one, so i knew what i was getting in to.<p>There were only a few options: a cross-compiler framework like Cocotron (compile on Mac, run on Linux), one of the native *step libraries like GNUstep running on Linux or FreeBSD, or simply deploy on a Mac somewhere.<p>I tried all combinations other than Mac first, I built out a GNUstep environment with libobjc2 on FreeBSD, tried the cocotron-&#62;linux stuff, each time watching something blow up in my face due to my choice of components and my requirements.<p>While obj-c is cross platform, some of the libraries and features I chose to use were not. CocoaHTTPServer is built on top of CFNetwork, which is not part of any obj-c framework/library, but rather a lower level Apple C library only found on Macs. There's a ""lite"" open source version, but I quickly discovered that solving one issue like that would only bring up another. For instance, dispatch blocks will only work with GNUstep at the moment, and only when it is compiled with clang, against libobjc2, a combination few if any Linux distros actually ship in their repos.<p>Not a lot of people interested in deploying modern, dispatch/block-heavy, obj-c 2.0 code to Linux, not nearly as many as there are deploying such things to OS X or iOS.<p>So I decided why not just run on a Mac server somewhere? After all I can't solve every problem all at the same time, and on a Mac a lot of those problems were non-existent, plus the Mac approach would allow me to use things only available on a Mac, like easy sandboxing and potentially keychain integration for auth.<p>I found a Mac VPS provider that ran Xserves and hosted copies of Lion server inside VMware (HostMyApple, not someone fudging the licensing in moms basement). It worked really, really well, as long as I treated it like a headless server (issues with Lion Server are another story for another time). My sandboxing worked, performance was fantastic aside from the CPU usage during a cache miss, so I was fairly happy.<p>Long story short though, memory leaks in 3rd party libraries (that only someone running a server would likely hit), coupled with higher hosting costs (and fewer choices), smaller community and a desire to use some things that are really only ""mature"" in other languages (database adapters, etc), caused me to spend a few days porting the entire thing to Python.<p>My site now runs on a Linode, and is a nearly identical clone of the obj-c version, ported as a Python/Bottle app. There was nothing particularly wrong with the obj-c approach, but the primary focus of nearly all obj-c developers and libraries is iOS, where processes never live longer than a few minutes, or Mac where a crash or leak is only going to affect one person rather than a few hundred in-flight requests.

2011-11-12 19:57:50,"I felt the exact same way for a very, very long time. A few things changed my mind.<p>The first was the realization that Adobe wasn't going to make any more cool fun stuff for me. I feel like they've just lost their way with all that and now that I look back on it, it seems like Macromedia actually made all the aspects of Flash that I enjoy. The most recent thing Adobe has done for me is Stage3D but even that is so technical that they're relying on 3rd parties like Away3D to build the friendly API on top of it.<p>The second was doing a project that was as close to an art piece as I've ever come doing ad agency work that was entirely in HTML/CSS3 and JS. It was actually this project if you want to see some pictures: <a href=""http://inchwormstudio.com/?portfolio=samsung-coast-to-coast-photo-post"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inchwormstudio.com/?portfolio=samsung-coast-to-coast-...</a>
What I found while I was doing that project was that the web has changed a lot while I've been doing Flash and I didn't realize how much annoying obtuse boilerplate I had to write in AS3 that just becomes total cake when you're using HTML for markup, CSS for style and JS for slick transitions and communication. My main love affair is with HTML and JS, I still think CSS is...CSS. With HTML I'm getting all the great structural stuff that Flex devs love, without the mind numblingly elaborate class structures they have to deal with. With good JS libraries like jQuery I'm getting the cross browser DOM support that I need because I just don't have those sea legs yet. And when you combine it all you can work really, really fast. I spent the whole first half of that project cursing JavaScript up and down the office. I would make little examples showing how setInterval loses scope and demo it for my team and be like ""look! this stuff is retarded! I want AS3 back!"" Then one day I had to build this twitter widget, and I sat down and I just cranked it out in no time. And I thought, 'You know, if I had been doing this in Flash I would have spent so much time dealing with URLLoaders and cross policy files and coreLib for JSON parsing...' It just felt like things had gone smoother because I wasn't fighting against the web to make it fit inside my Flash app. And that was about the time that I felt like I got over the hump, and from there it was all downhill.<p>It totally had warts and I got stung by IE transparency bugs but in the end we sorted it all out and now I know how to deal with those issues. And to be honest, they were pretty minimal. The Facebook API was far worse than the cross browser stuff.<p>If you're making the transition then read this: <a href=""http://jqfundamentals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqfundamentals.com/</a>
I read it start to finish and it made things so much easier for me. Then once you're comfortable with jQuery, leave it behind and try the other stuff. It feels like there is SO much more to experiment with in the JS world than the AS world and I think that's largely because the community is exponentially larger.

If you are broke, like me then consider using an email to sms gateway. you will need to know the subscriber's provider. It can work if you are offering a one-way sms service such as updates. Watch out for SMSC spam catchers . 2. If you have money, but no time then you can use a provider such as Clickatell or Verisign and they will do all the background work. All you will need is an access to their API plus a monthly fee of 500-1500/month on top of SMS fees. 3. You have money plus time plus contacts then Forget all these guys and provision your own short-code, then start emailing your contacts at Verizon and them to  give you access to their SMSC. When people say ""I don't know how twitter pays for 250k SMS/month"" they don't know that Twitter is probably paying less than your startup will for 10k SMS. that is the advantage of working directly with the carriers. SMS is super cheap for them. 4. You got money, but want to be careful, then I suggest <a href=""http://mobivity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobivity.com</a> or <a href=""http://textmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://textmarks</a>. This service charge you for zero to only a few bucks and give you a unique keyword plus short-code.

Textmarks doesn't have an API to my knowledge but you can certainly email Ariel Poller. i would try something like apoller or a.poller@textmarks.com. Be smart when you choose a provider that offers a short-code.When you rent a shared short-code, it can change at any time and now your 50k users have to know your new short-code. If you are doing a interactive SMS service, that can suck. If you are going for the private short-code, then you are safe as a long as you can shell out 1000/month. If you are proficient with Mobile applications, the best way to go is to build your own messaging application. Now when someone sends you a SMS or you send your user a sms ask send them a link as well and ask them to download it. there you have it, no more SMS fees for that guy and your messages can be 500 characters long.

2011-04-14 00:30:50,"If you want something simple without writing much code, go with PayPal. You'd expect some ""horror stories"" from a payment processor with 232 million accounts. Virtually all of them involve someone doing something that'd raise flags at any merchant account provider or bank, it's just that people think PayPal isn't a bank so they should be able to get away with anything. 10,000 horror stories still leaves 99.99% of users happy.<p>If you want to accept credit cards on your own site, you need to learn about PCIDSS compliance, you need to apply for a merchant account, and you need to a payment gateway that works with that merchant account.<p>It's well within reach of a lean startup. The application is usually a page or two long, you'll get approval from the underwriting bank within a week or so, and most MAPs also resell the payment gateway accounts so they set that up for you and you get everything at once. The fixed costs will be a statement fee and a gateway fee, $20-30 a month total.<p>It's terribly difficult to understand the fees you'll be paying with a merchant account. They're far more complex than whatever you get quoted will lead you to expect, and it's absolutely common for providers to change the fees on a monthly basis such that after a year you have no idea what you're paying. There can be dozens of classes of credit cards each with different rates when you charge them. My only advice for dealing with that is to try not to tie your code to your processor so that, when you grow enough for the fees to matter, you can shop around for a better deal.<p>You don't get to take shortcuts with the PCI stuff. The fine for a credit card being compromised from your server because you weren't PCIDSS compliant start at $500,000 per incident (paid to Visa/MC) plus legal fees and costs to provide credit monitoring to the victims.<p>If you accept credit cards directly on your site, you'll be required to fill out a self-assessment questionnaire and have a compliance scan against your server run on some basis. For most ecommerce setups, it'll be quarterly. What that costs depends on your merchant account provider; some contract with and pay a compliance company for you, others you have to pay some or all of the costs yourself, which can be a couple hundred dollars a year. SecurityMetrics seems to be the most popular service for the scans.<p>The technical part is easy. An Authorize.net integration will take you a couple hours <i>at most</i>. There are libraries for the popular payment gateways in every programming language known to man, and prebuilt shopping carts will have plugins/modules/whatever written by people already.<p>It's just like any other API.

    - Behavior of specific API calls are only
      changed during major releases.

2018-07-05 23:08:09,"For one: vue, vuex (centralized state library) and vue-router are stewarted by roughly the same people, which has a few benefits. The documentation is all pretty decent and uniform. I never sit for very long wondering how to do something.<p>Changes that break backwards compatibility are reflected across all three at the same time, and the correct versions are installed by vue-cli. I had several starts with react, react-router, and redux, and on almost every occasion something from my last attempt was broken because the api had changed, and the documentation changed with it (in the span of 3-4 months). That lead to several WTF moments. IIRC there was a period where react-router made some breaking changes from v2 to v3, and then less than a year later made more breaking changes for v4.<p>Vue is also a lot simpler to drop into an existing application. The .vue single-file component is very approachable, albeit a bit magic but about as magic as JSX. You can add a vue-loader for sass&#x2F;less&#x2F;etc. and simply specify lang=&quot;less&quot; in these as well.<p>Vuex was a little easier for me to grok, although I had the advantage of trying out redux first. It has the advantage again of sharing documentation with the rest of the project.<p>Also, because react has worked for big companies as you mentioned, does not mean vue couldn&#x27;t work for them as well. React gained a lot of momentum early among western programmers. Vue first gained traction in Asia - Evan You, the creator of vue, is from there. Also you might remember the massive amount of confusion for early React adopters regarding how to manage state. People liked react, but it only really had the view part ready out of the gate.

2018-07-03 01:29:50,"There are two closely intertwined but separate issues: centralization and governance.<p>Current web technology typically sees one entity controlling the data; if you sign up for a website, your data goes in their database.  That&#x27;s due to the common stack we all build on: some form of API&#x2F;web server, some form of SQL&#x2F;NoSQL database, some form of client.  If we had a world where developers could simply and freely implement services on top of a <i>different</i> paradigm, we&#x27;d stop having to worry about big central entities like Facebook, Google, your local computer store, whoever -- being able to sell your data.  They simply wouldn&#x27;t have it.  I&#x27;m not sure what that paradigm is, but IPFS, Secure Scuttlebutt, Solid, the Dat Project etc. are all interesting takes on what a solution to that problem might look like.<p>At the other end of the spectrum is governance, which is something sorely lacking, and allows these misinformation campaigns to spread so freely.  Do we still have to worry about governance in a world where we own our own data?  Yes, probably, if the surge of illegal and genuinely nasty content like Child Pornography on the new big distributed networks (eg. ZeroNet) is any indicator.  Censorship is a spectrum, and while I can appreciate sticking to the view that free speech is best for all, there are some behaviours which society has mostly agreed are objectionable.<p>The current paradigm of each social service provider essentially being a self-determining fiefdom isn&#x27;t too dissimilar to how humaity&#x27;s always done things, I guess (for instance, different pubs&#x2F;bars will have differing clienteles and degrees of socially acceptable behaviour), except for the scale -- which unfortunately probably does merit a change in how our current major sites are run (YouTube and Twitter in particular seem like they&#x27;ve been gamed incredibly well by cynical parties).  I don&#x27;t know how we solve this problem, but better technical underpinnings might make this a simpler problem to solve.  Independently, however, I note that there are places like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.coop"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.coop</a> where they&#x27;re trying to take that problem on head-first.<p>It will be interesting to see what the next few years of the internet look like.

2018-05-14 16:58:31,"For those who are unable&#x2F;unwilling to access Facebook:<p>John Carmack<p>Steve Jobs<p>My wife once asked me “Why do you drop what you are doing when Steve Jobs asks you to do something? You don’t do that for anyone else.”<p>It is worth thinking about.<p>As a teenage Apple computer fan, Jobs and Wozniak were revered figures for me, and wanting an Apple 2 was a defining characteristic of several years of my childhood. Later on, seeing NeXT at a computer show just as I was selling my first commercial software felt like a vision into the future. (But $10k+, yikes!)<p>As Id Software grew successful through Commander Keen and Wolfenstein 3D, the first major personal purchase I made wasn’t a car, but rather a NeXT computer. It turned out to be genuinely valuable for our software development, and we moved the entire company onto NeXT hardware.<p>We loved our NeXTs, and we wanted to launch Doom with an explicit “Developed on NeXT computers” logo during the startup process, but when we asked, the request was denied.<p>Some time after launch, when Doom had begun to make its cultural mark, we heard that Steve had changed his mind and would be happy to have NeXT branding on it, but that ship had sailed. I did think it was cool to trade a few emails with Steve Jobs.<p>Several things over the years made me conclude that, at his core, Steve didn’t think very highly of games, and always wished they weren’t as important to his platforms as they turned out to be. I never took it personally.<p>When NeXT managed to sort of reverse-acquire Apple and Steve was back in charge, I was excited by the possibilities of a resurgent Apple with the virtues of NeXT in a mainstream platform.<p>I was brought in to talk about the needs of games in general, but I made it my mission to get Apple to adopt OpenGL as their 3D graphics API. I had a lot of arguments with Steve.<p>Part of his method, at least with me, was to deride contemporary options and dare me to tell him differently. They might be pragmatic, but couldn’t actually be good. “I have Pixar. We will make something [an API] that is actually good.”<p>It was often frustrating, because he could talk, with complete confidence, about things he was just plain wrong about, like the price of memory for video cards and the amount of system bandwidth exploitable by the AltiVec extensions.<p>But when I knew what I was talking about, I would stand my ground against anyone.<p>When Steve did make up his mind, he was decisive about it. Dictates were made, companies were acquired, keynotes were scheduled, and the reality distortion field kicked in, making everything else that was previously considered into obviously terrible ideas.<p>I consider this one of the biggest indirect impacts on the industry that I have had. OpenGL never seriously threatened D3D on PC, but it was critical at Apple, and that meant that it remained enough of a going concern to be the clear choice when mobile devices started getting GPUs. While long in the tooth now, it was so much better than what we would have gotten if half a dozen SoC vendors rolled their own API back at the dawn of the mobile age.<p>I wound up doing several keynotes with Steve, and it was always a crazy fire drill with not enough time to do things right, and generally requiring heroic effort from many people to make it happen at all. I tend to think this was also a calculated part of his method.<p>My first impression of “Keynote Steve” was him berating the poor stage hands over “This Home Depot shit” that was rolling out the display stand with the new Mac, very much not to his satisfaction. His complaints had a valid point, and he improved the quality of the presentation by caring about details, but I wouldn’t have wanted to work for him in that capacity.<p>One time, my wife, then fiancé, and I were meeting with Steve at Apple, and he wanted me to do a keynote that happened to be scheduled on the same day as our wedding. With a big smile and full of charm, he suggested that we postpone it. We declined, but he kept pressing. Eventually my wife countered with a suggestion that if he really wanted “her” John so much, he should loan John Lassiter to her media company for a day of consulting. Steve went from full charm to ice cold really damn quick. I didn’t do that keynote.<p>When I was preparing an early technology demo of Doom 3 for a keynote in Japan, I was having a hard time dealing with some of the managers involved that were insisting that I change the demo because “Steve doesn’t like blood.” I knew that Doom 3 wasn’t to his taste, but that wasn’t the point of doing the demo.<p>I brought it to Steve, with all the relevant people on the thread. He replied to everyone with:<p>“I trust you John, do whatever you think is great.”<p>That goes a long way, and nobody said a thing after that.<p>When my wife and I later started building games for feature phones (DoomRPG! Orcs&amp;Elves!), I advocated repeatedly to Steve that an Apple phone could be really great. Every time there was a rumor that Apple might be working on a phone, I would refine the pitch to him. Once he called me at home on a Sunday (How did he even get my number?) to ask a question, and I enthused at length about the possibilities.<p>I never got brought into the fold, but I was excited when the iPhone actually did see the light of day. A giant (for the time) true color display with a GPU! We could do some amazing things with this!<p>Steve first talked about application development for iPhone at the some keynote I was demonstrating the new ID Tech 5 rendering engine on Mac, so I was in the front row. When he started going on about “Web Apps”, I was (reasonably quietly) going “Booo!!!”.<p>After the public cleared out and the rest of us were gathered in front of the stage, I started urgently going on about how web apps are terrible, and wouldn’t show the true potential of the device. We could do so much more with real native access!<p>Steve responded with a line he had used before: “Bad apps could bring down cell phone towers.” I hated that line. He could have just said “We aren’t ready”, and that would have been fine.<p>I was making some guesses, but I argued that the iPhone hardware and OS provided sufficient protection for native apps. I pointed at a nearby engineer and said “Don’t you have an MMU and process isolation on the iPhone now?” He had a wide eyed look of don’t-bring-me-into-this, but I eventually got a “yes” out of him.<p>I said that OS-X was surely being used for things that were more security critical than a phone, and if Apple couldn’t provide enough security there, they had bigger problems. He came back with a snide “You’re a smart guy John, why don’t you write a new OS?” At the time, my thought was, “Fuck you, Steve.”.<p>People were backing away from us. If Steve was mad, Apple employees didn’t want him to associate the sight of them with the experience. Afterwards, one of the execs assured me that “Steve appreciates vigorous conversation”.<p>Still deeply disappointed about it, I made some comments that got picked up by the press. Steve didn’t appreciate that.<p>The Steve Jobs “hero &#x2F; shithead” rollercoaster was real, and after riding high for a long time, I was now on the down side. Someone told me that Steve explicitly instructed them to not give me access to the early iPhone SDK when it finally was ready.<p>I wound up writing several successful iPhone apps on the side (all of which are now gone due to dropping 32 bit support, which saddens me), and I had many strong allies inside Apple, but I was on the outs with Steve.<p>The last iOS product I worked on was Rage for iOS, which I thought set a new bar for visual richness on mobile, and also supported some brand new features like TV out. I heard that it was well received inside Apple.<p>I was debriefing the team after the launch when I got a call. I was busy, so I declined it. A few minutes later someone came in and said that Steve was going to call me. Oops.<p>Everyone had a chuckle about me “hanging up on Steve Jobs”, but that turned out to be my last interaction with him.<p>As the public story of his failing health progressed, I started several emails to try to say something meaningful and positive to part on, but I never got through them, and I regret it.<p>I corroborate many of the negative character traits that he was infamous for, but elements of the path that led to where I am today were contingent on the dents he left in the universe.<p>I showed up for him.",Facebook,unabl #x2f unwil access facebook <p> john carmack <p> steve job

2018-04-25 11:41:10,"You can make an exact comparison. Not too terribly long ago I saw protests holding up poster sized pictures of prisoner abuse from Abu Gharib and Guantanamo Bay, which is roughly like holding up a poster-sized picture from the 1989 massacre. Nothing happened to these people in spite of the fact that these pictures are deeply embarrassing to the US government and intensely inflammatory in regions of the world where we don&#x27;t want to be inflammatory.<p>As much as I give Snowden credit for exposing what can be dangerous autocratic programs, I also must point out that Snowden was not just some random protester. Snowden violated a government secrecy oath that he signed, which is a crime and this fact is printed rather boldly on the contract. Nobody forces you to sign these oaths. You can always say &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I can&#x27;t sign this, I quit&quot; and walk out and get another job.<p>That&#x27;s part of what &quot;the rule of law&quot; actually means. In a nation with the rule of law, the law applies objectively to everyone: crooks, politicians, and yes even do-gooders. If the law is wrong you can vote for representatives to change it, but until then what&#x27;s written is the law. If the law says it&#x27;s illegal to hop on a pogo stick, then anyone hopping on a pogo stick gets arrested even if they&#x27;re on their way to feed starving orphans.<p>(Secret courts are another matter, and I think those are un-American and should be shut down. But they are used far less in America than in China, and when they are used and the fact becomes known there&#x27;s generally quite an uproar.)<p>Also-- personally I find the NSA and CIA less alarming than Facebook and Google. Three-letter agencies operate with at least some democratic oversight and the intel they gather does tend to be used primarily for legitimate intelligence and national security purposes. Unfortunately we do not live on planet fluffy bunny hugs and we need an intelligence service and a military.

2018-04-24 08:14:40,"Due to the GDPR Facebook added all kinds of new controls. I looked through them today.<p>Stuff Facebook has tracked, despite not using their app on my phone (preloaded but completely disabled) and using their website only with uBlock Origin):<p>a) everywhere you ever used Facebook to login to a website. I thought I never did this but apparently I still had 5+ websites linked to this. They seem to use this to profile you. Facebook mentions about this _&quot;These are active apps and websites. This means that you recently logged in to them using Facebook, and they can request information you&#x27;ve chosen to share with them.&quot;_ I never wanted to share anything, but Facebook often changes settings or pretends I did<p>b) every time you connected an app to your Facebook account. Apparently I again did at a few times (to easily upload some photos). I also saw old phones in here, Runkeeper (don&#x27;t recall using that), Tinder (haven&#x27;t used in years). All of those seem to forever be able to get information from you.<p>c) topics (yet another new name). Not sure how they figured things like that out. Fortunately you can completely disable the personal tracking, though you need to do that in various different places.<p>d) advertisers whom added their contact list to Facebook. Really!! So some other company shared my details with Facebook. Which means they&#x27;ve also shared details of people not using Facebook with Facebook.<p>e) used websites and apps. This is surprisingly accurate and complete (hundreds of sites+apps!), despite having the Fb app disabled plus always using uBlock Origin. I really wonder if they somehow are able to retrieve the browser history. It seems Facebook also tracks you using &quot;apps using Facebook technology&quot;, which I guess is a library to show ads or something which uses the app permissions to further track the user.<p>f) it uses your profile (relationship status, employer, job title, education) to targets ads<p>g) somehow puts you into categories. E.g. &quot;uses a mobile device (xx to xx months)&quot;. I disabled this crap yesterday, it updated it today with more information. I assume through Whatsapp&#x2F;Instagram or maybe some kind of Facebook ad library? Again, I don&#x27;t want it to track me, yet they seem to be easily able to do this. I turned off all the settings but apparently still missed a few.<p>i) ads topics. Not sure how topics differs from the 3 other ways they call this.<p>j) your location. It doesn&#x27;t show what it does with this. You cannot disable the location tracking; it suggests to turn it off in the phone settings (which is a cop-out). I&#x27;ll need to download my data to further determine this. I&#x27;m pretty sure Facebook is big enough to figure out additional ways of location tracking than just what Android&#x2F;iPhone allows.<p>k) websites visited. I assume any link clicked. This is somehow different than all the other ways it already showed websites.<p>l) the existing &quot;Who can contact you using email address &#x2F; phone number&quot;. It says &quot;Who&quot;, but it is used for the API as well, that&#x27;s not a user so I find the usage of &quot;Who&quot; misleading.<p>Despite doing all of this, still not sure how to prevent something like Cambridge Analytica from downloading my data through others (&quot;friend&quot;).

Facebook previously offered a solution to users who didn&#x27;t want their info being shared with app developers over the Facebook Platform every time a one of their friends added an app: users could select a privacy option telling Facebook to &quot;not share any information about me through the Facebook API.&quot;&quot;</i><p>Well, it turns out EFF was correct and accurately predicted the unethical scenario of Cambridge Analytica siphoning data from Facebook users who didn&#x27;t even take their quiz.<p>The bullet points of &quot;fixes&quot; that MZ outlined don&#x27;t really address the fundamental problem.

2018-04-09 03:35:10,"I can imagine how this evolved -- somewhere at Apple HQ, a whiteboarding session about classes of information and capabilities that the OS will gatekeep, which got us to Contacts, Photos, Camera, Microphone, Location. Presumably apps would be extensively curated, keeping out the scummiest of the lot, and apps were envisioned as asking for permissions directly relevant to their utility so having separate read&#x2F;write permissions would be overkill.<p>When Android cloned the same model, they got much more granular with permissions [1][2], but then completely undermined it by making it occur only once at app install. As someone put it [3], they&#x27;re not permissions because you can&#x27;t turn them off -- they&#x27;re warnings about what the app does. Then they further mucked this up, by eventually grouping them together into broad categories within which apps could automagically gain all other permissions without your approval [4].<p>Then, the following year, in 2015, they finally introduced iOS-style runtime-granted permissions, if your device was lucky enough to be up-to-date and your apps were gracious enough to target the new API level; otherwise you missed out on this change.<p>In fairness, by this point, hoover-style request-everything permission requests were extremely common among mainstream apps like Facebook, Messenger, Snapchat... so reigning in on contact-harvesting flashlight apps was a bit of a lost cause.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;android&#x2F;Manifest.permission.html#READ_CONTACTS"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;android&#x2F;Manifest.per...</a> [2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;android&#x2F;Manifest.permission.html#WRITE_CONTACTS"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.android.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;android&#x2F;Manifest.per...</a>

2018-04-04 19:14:38,"Two weeks ago we promised to take a hard look at the information apps can use when you connect them to Facebook as well as other data practices. Today, we want to update you on the changes we’re making to better protect your Facebook information. We expect to make more changes over the coming months — and will keep you updated on our progress. Here are the details of the nine most important changes we are making.<p>Events API: Until today, people could grant an app permission to get information about events they host or attend, including private events. This made it easy to add Facebook Events to calendar, ticketing or other apps. But Facebook Events have information about other people’s attendance as well as posts on the event wall, so it’s important that we ensure apps use their access appropriately. Starting today, apps using the API will no longer be able to access the guest list or posts on the event wall. And in the future, only apps we approve that agree to strict requirements will be allowed to use the Events API.<p>Groups API: Currently apps need the permission of a group admin or member to access group content for closed groups, and the permission of an admin for secret groups. These apps help admins do things like easily post and respond to content in their groups. However, there is information about people and conversations in groups that we want to make sure is better protected. Going forward, all third-party apps using the Groups API will need approval from Facebook and an admin to ensure they benefit the group. Apps will no longer be able to access the member list of a group. And we’re also removing personal information, such as names and profile photos, attached to posts or comments that approved apps can access.<p>Pages API: Until today, any app could use the Pages API to read posts or comments from any Page. This let developers create tools for Page owners to help them do things like schedule posts and reply to comments or messages. But it also let apps access more data than necessary. We want to make sure Page information is only available to apps providing useful services to our community. So starting today, all future access to the Pages API will need to be approved by Facebook.<p>Facebook Login: Two weeks ago we announced important changes to Facebook Login. Starting today, Facebook will need to approve all apps that request access to information such as check-ins, likes, photos, posts, videos, events and groups. We started approving these permissions in 2014, but now we’re tightening our review process — requiring these apps to agree to strict requirements before they can access this data. We will also no longer allow apps to ask for access to personal information such as religious or political views, relationship status and details, custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness activity, book reading activity, music listening activity, news reading, video watch activity, and games activity. In the next week, we will remove a developer’s ability to request data people shared with them if it appears they have not used the app in the last 3 months.<p>Instagram Platform API: We’re making the recently announced deprecation of the Instagram Platform API effective today. You can find more information here.<p>Search and Account Recovery: Until today, people could enter another person’s phone number or email address into Facebook search to help find them. This has been especially useful for finding your friends in languages which take more effort to type out a full name, or where many people have the same name. In Bangladesh, for example, this feature makes up 7% of all searches. However, malicious actors have also abused these features to scrape public profile information by submitting phone numbers or email addresses they already have through search and account recovery. Given the scale and sophistication of the activity we’ve seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way. So we have now disabled this feature. We’re also making changes to account recovery to reduce the risk of scraping as well.<p>Call and Text History: Call and text history is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This means we can surface the people you most frequently connect with at the top of your contact list. We’ve reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not collect the content of messages — and will delete all logs older than one year. In the future, the client will only upload to our servers the information needed to offer this feature — not broader data such as the time of calls.<p>Data Providers and Partner Categories: Last week we announced our plans to shut down Partner Categories, a product that lets third-party data providers offer their targeting directly on Facebook.<p>App Controls: Finally, starting on Monday, April 9, we’ll show people a link at the top of their News Feed so they can see what apps they use — and the information they have shared with those apps. People will also be able to remove apps that they no longer want. As part of this process we will also tell people if their information may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.<p>In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people — mostly in the US — may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.<p>Overall, we believe these changes will better protect people’s information while still enabling developers to create useful experiences. We know we have more work to do — and we’ll keep you updated as we make more changes.

2018-03-28 22:52:10,"The Facebook API has been useless since 2014 when most access to friend data was cutoff.  Since then, if your objective was data collection, that could be easily achieved  by scraping publicly available information (many friends lists are public, there are many public posts, etc. - certainly enough to use in aggregate to formulate campaign strategies etc.). I suspect that will be the next “scandal,” since in 2018, people can’t possibly take personal responsibility for the things they post and allow to be public.<p>Ironically, the “scandal” that caused this whole thing is a non-issue. Pre-2014 Facebook apps could collect a lot of information about you and your friends, along with their Facebook user IDs, and that was scary because there was a time when you could simply submit a list of user ID’s that you wanted to show a specific ad to.  But since Facebook advertising cannot be targeted by user ID anymore, and this policy was in place well before the 2016 election, all of that data was essentially useless to any participant in the 2016 election other than for aggregate things like general campaign strategies.  I am intimately familiar with the advertise by ID issue - I was awarded a $2k Facebook bug bounty for spotting an exploit in the Custom Audiences feature that allowed an equivalent version of targeting by ID after they disallowed it.<p>So while it’s possible that Obama used his special access to the entire US social graph to successfully influence his elections, it is impossible for Trump or Hillary to have done it <i>even if they had the data</i> because of the changes in the FB ad platform in between 2012 and 2016.  This entire “scandal” was created and promoted by people that don’t understand, or actively ignored, this concept.  If you ask everyone that has read the recent headlines, including reporters that wrote the stories, I’ll bet 99%+ will tell you that they believe they could be specifically targeted with ads.<p>It would be interesting to see if the executives at any of the media companies that have managed to sell this scandal to the public took unusually large short positions in Facebook stock before releasing the story.  Since the story is effectively fraudulent (it was not possible for the election to have been influenced in the way that the stories imply), I assume that would be securities fraud.",Facebook,"facebook api useless sinc 2014 access friend data cutoff sinc object data collect could easili achiev scrape publicli avail inform mani friend list public mani public post etc certainli enough use aggreg formul campaign strategi etc suspect next “ scandal ” sinc 2018, peopl ’ possibl take person respons thing post allow public <p> iron “ scandal ” caus whole thing non-issu pre 2014 facebook app could collect lot inform friend along facebook user id scari time could simpli submit list user id ’ want show specif ad sinc facebook advertis cannot target user id anymor polici place well 2016 elect data essenti useless particip 2016 elect aggreg thing like gener campaign strategi intim familiar advertis id issu award 2 k facebook bug bounti spot exploit custom audienc featur allow equival version target id disallow <p> ’ possibl obama use special access entir us social graph success influenc elect imposs trump hillari done <i> even data </i> chang fb ad platform 2012 2016 entir “ scandal ” creat promot peopl ’ understand activ ignor concept ask everyon read recent headlin includ report wrote stori ’ bet 99 tell believ could specif target ad <p> would interest see execut media compani manag sell scandal public took unusu larg short posit facebook stock releas stori sinc stori effect fraudul possibl elect influenc way stori impli assum would secur fraud",0.18239348370927322,0.3607769423558897

2018-03-21 20:37:57,"&gt; First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit.<p>I remember the old days of the graph API - there was a whole lot you could do with someone&#x27;s account, and it was common for users, especially non technical users to blindly hit accept on the permissions screens.  If I&#x27;m not mistaken, you could even make a developer account without a verified phone number at the time.<p>I don&#x27;t think banning some of those apps is any kind of consolation really. The API sat like that for years. Anyone with nefarious motives already took what they wanted and ran. What repercussions will they face? The will be banned from Facebook? The apps are probably long gone. There was a time when Facebook apps were at their peak, that fad died off. The data is probably sitting in a database somewhere today. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, Facebook Games could still grab the friend list permission until quite recently.<p>Also what authority does Facebook have to do any kind of audit? How would that audit even work? If someone copies all the data to an external drive and locks it up, what will the audit reveal? &quot;Yep there&#x27;s no data here, pinky swear!&quot;<p>The basic premise of Facebook is flawed. If your private thoughts or photos are posted on a platform where you don&#x27;t control the data, the data is never safe. A good product that serves the user faithfully and takes this into account is probably closer to a decentralized product - maybe something like Mastodon (I haven&#x27;t looked into it in much detail).

2018-03-19 19:15:35,"This is hyperbole. He created an app, wrote in the description that it was for academic purposes, and then later amended the description &#x2F; TOS to allow selling of data. Facebook is faulting him because he did not update them on the purpose of the app.<p>There were no systemic barriers in place that Kogan had to circumvent to get access to the data; the Facebook API worked as expected and gave it to him. Regardless of the original “purpose” of the app (a small textarea input you supply to FB), the API would provide the data. The “purpose” of an app does not affect what data is available to it in any meaningful way.<p>The idea that he should have notified Facebook of the changes is laughable; all he had to do is change a few text inputs to update the TOS. The FB platform does not treat an app differently based on its purpose. This is CYA language from FB trying to obfuscate the fact that <i>any and every app</i> has access to this same data, and FB has no control over what happens to the data once an app extracts it. Indeed, much of their business model depends on this premise.<p>Further, the practice of changing terms &#x2F; functionality of an app is a laughably commonplace way of circumventing the nearly non-existent FB platform review process.<p>I have personally seen much worse incidents of FB app abuse in the wild.

Kinda like you don&#x27;t buy an Oracle license to make a todo app. So there&#x27;s some backlash in the blogs. Upcoming versions of React include better&#x2F;expanded global state management (the context API). Some of what people use Redux for now will be better served by that API.<p>Redux also doesn&#x27;t tie in with any specific database or backend. As other vertically integrated solutions take shape, that will also cut into Redux&#x27;s usage. At facebook, this would be Relay, a GraphQL library. A lot of people are excited about using a query language to talk to the server. It makes versioning and supporting multiple generic apps&#x2F;features much simpler.

2018-02-22 03:22:38,"This could still become a problem (if each dependency statically bundles its own dependencies) if any of the types are exposed in an API.

2018-02-20 19:06:58,"I am not a coder by any means, but I am a heavy social media user and know a lot about politics, sociology, psych, organizing, health, comms---and I admit, until I read this thread, I liked this article because it gave me a better reason for all the screw ups, beyond, &quot;The Executives are dithering and have no business skills and social skills.&quot; Or the theory &quot;The Executives do nothing because they don&#x27;t care if women and vulnerable people die.&quot; Which is far more disturbing....it can&#x27;t be true, even if it <i>feels</i> true.
I would give anything if they&#x27;d listen to users who have been around awhile. So few people worked there and also used it at the same time. (And users longingly miss the Fail Whale logo...)
As a user (250,000+ tweets) under a pseudonym, twitter has incredible uses, things Facebook and other platforms didn&#x27;t do, because they were so closed and hard to search. They created echo Chambers, because you could only see people you already knew or were slightly connected too. Or worse, your mom or mother-in-law could find you. Twitter was so open--if I want to discuss philosophy or Japanese food or an MRI result, 24&#x2F;7 I just search and people who love that are there. And pseudonyms had to exist, because thousands of people in real life have the same name. (just like the rest of the Internet back then and yes, now too) They thought people would just post status updates like, hey eating lunch, but we did way way more. They made it 140 chars with 20 chars reserved for names because many people had expensive tiny data plans, but could update by text message; allowing a much wider demographic to use it, and across multiple countries, even low tech ones with limited access. 
The most critical piece tho is that users invented everything good about twitter (Sorry creators--but we did). TW allowed some html symbols, so a user put an @ in front of a user name to reply, and it worked! Users also invented hashtags, the first one was for organizing BarCamp--which was kind of a conference not about alcohol and the original manual RT, and MT for modified tweet, and commenting on top of  someone&#x27;s tweet, or at the end of it and we figured out how to shrink long urls to post links. bit.ly had no purpose til then, and many users became Developers and got full access to the API and we crowdsourced hundreds of changes and ideas, from pictures to videos to emoji to gifs to analytics, to accessible apps for people with vision, hearing, speech issues. All while making lots and lots of jokes.
They didn&#x27;t start out with a heavy respect for pseudonyms, and privacy, and free speech--but TW learned it fast after the Green Iran Revolution, and after many patient users wanted to keep privacy because they had rare diseases, and mental health issues, and parents of kids with autism and speech issues took to it and found each other and felt less alone. It was less complicated than blogging and writing long stories on laptops after events happened. I could do everything from live tweeting a doctor&#x27;s appt to an ER visit and get reactions from friends who could tell me what to ask. 
We still tweet everything from recipes to exact instructions on how to ride a bike, how to organize groups like #occupy to crowd sourcing Flu symptoms and rashes, to who is watching what TV show and how cool it is to watch live sports &quot;together&quot; even for people who can&#x27;t leave the house that night and meet.
Weekly hour long Chats take place under special hashtags like #hcsm for Health Care Social Media or #meded for medical education. (doctors and science fans and academics found twitter and they debate articles, techniques, crowdsource diagnoses)
Police and emergency responders and good Samaritans have used it to (swear to god, it&#x27;s true) befriend people who sound troubled or suicidal and validate their pain and sadness and find them help.
It is to this day, the only platform I know that allows people from many different areas to find like-minded people and to bring together people across multiple subject areas.

Still we are definitely in the fragile tail end and the crash could come literally any second now.<p>I lived through dot.com and housing mania and I&#x27;m having serious deja moo right now. Deja moo is when you&#x27;ve seen this bull before. On a recent flight I saw a long format in-flight advertising video for DASH, an altcoin. I repeat: <i>airline advertisements!</i> If you still have doubts that we are in gibbering flapdoodle land, head over to YouTube:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hXRhIXp4idM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hXRhIXp4idM</a><p>We have <i>celebrity endorsements</i> and <i>music videos</i>. Run away.<p>I think the crash is going to look a lot like a bank run. There will be some piece of news that triggers it (exchange collapse, policy change, who knows) and then everyone will scramble to cash out. It will quickly become obvious that there is insufficient USD&#x2F;EUR&#x2F;etc. on hand to actually back the current market cap of the top ten coins. At that point exchanges will halt trading. Lawsuits will be filed. Exchanges will go into receivership. More lawsuits will be filed. Criminal charges may start getting filed. You get the picture.<p>Most of the crime and financial fraud that will happen in this bubble is happening now or will happen during the crash itself. Most financial fraud is driven by frantic attempts to cover one&#x27;s ass. My guess is that top people at all the exchanges know they are in serious trouble and there are many frantic meetings going on debating what can possibly be done. Since a bubble is basically a naturally occurring emergent Ponzi scheme, the only way &quot;out&quot; is to get more dumb money in so smart money can exit... hence the airline advertisements and Facebook ads to buy coins. I am currently seeing a <i>lot</i> of the latter.<p>Sadly a lot of naive people will lose tons of money. People have been dumping their life savings and mortgaging their houses to get into this. It could have follow-on effects on the economy. Some of the big Bitcoin exchanges are privately insured, so I wonder if it could drag down a few insurance companies. The rest of the economy is fragile so it&#x27;s not impossible that this could trigger a recession.<p>Cryptocurrency will not go away post-crash any more than the Internet went away post dot.com crash. We&#x27;re just approaching the irrational exuberance peak of the new technology adoption hype cycle.<p>After the crash it will go back to being a semi-underground niche thing for a while. Valuations will return to sanity. Those exchanges and other businesses that do survive will gain a lot of experience and a reputation for stability. Ironically sometimes the best technical work gets done post-crash, so I wonder if after the crash we will finally see useful applications built on this tech beyond its core currency use case.<p>If you really believe in the long term promise of this technology, after the crash would be the time to buy in.<p>P.S.<p>I really wish high schools would teach a class on finance, and if they did it should include a lesson on bubbles and a study of a few recent ones like dot.com and housing. People should be educated about what a bubble looks like and how to avoid getting ruined by one.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t stop everyone. The allure of herd behavior and gambling is strong.

The content industry fought against it, but developers came up with decentralized solutions like DHTs or supernodes.<p>I was convinced the next step would be friend-of-a-friend sharing.

For fun, here&#x27;s how we score on the article&#x27;s items:<p>1. No scammers. We require providers to be vetted in some way (references). Clients are going to need to provide screening to see providers.<p>2-A. We use our custom login system. Verifying your social media account is just a read-once thing we do; we don&#x27;t ever have access to post. In fact, it is unlikely we&#x27;d even get approved for an API key on most platforms.<p>2-B. For launch we&#x27;re pretty exclusionary :(. Focusing on cishet couplings, female provider. We&#x27;re going to address that as soon as possible. Queer sex workers face additional challenges for sure.<p>3. Data safety. Due to our company&#x27;s legal status (extrajurisdictional), we have to deeply hide all data. Our servers don&#x27;t have persistent storage, RAM only. (At boot, it&#x27;s a manual restore from something like Tarsnap.) Only a few people have root or raw DB access. This does not include most devops people - they go through a change approval process. Real access is limited to core members heavily vested in the company with a need-to-know. More at [1], please ignore the clickbait title.<p>Another key point: connectivity is heavily restricted. App servers only have inbound socket from their hidden service, plus outbound to the DB layer hidden service. DB layer only has that inbound socket. DB requests are rate limited globally plus per user.<p>4. We&#x27;ll wipe your data shortly after deactivation <i>if</i> there are no abuse reports on your account. In which case we keep a photo ID and birthdate so you can&#x27;t sign up again and get a clean record. This is needed to protect user&#x27;s safety. But at least a photo is not so readily searchable.

2017-09-13 11:28:52,"At Facebook we discovered this is especially important for large sharded environments. As you add more shards, the chances that a migration will fail on at least one of them (simply due to hardware failure) increases.

Basically you `skeema init` to initially populate your CREATE statements (one file per table) from a db instance. You can then change those files locally and run `skeema diff` to view auto-generated DDL, or `skeema push` to actually execute it.

2017-06-10 21:40:21,"It isn&#x27;t just a company trying to abuse market advantage as tool to exploit consumers and crowd out the sector - it is if they are successful at it.<p>I don&#x27;t feel locked in to Google Wallet. That <i>is</i> changing, since there are only three &quot;blessed&quot; mobile payment systems now in Samsung, Android, and Apple Pay (rather than what we should have, a standard mobile payment API handled by ISO). But before, Paypal and Amazon Checkout both provided payment solutions that were rivals, with significant market shares, to Google Wallet.<p>The ad blocking in Chrome is obviously anti-competitive, but it waits to be seen if Google <i>has</i> actual monopolistic power in the browser space where this change doesn&#x27;t drive consumers to competitors. If the advertisers Google is trying to bully fight back by having their affiliates block Chrome, either those businesses die or Chrome loses market share. We will have to see what happens, but I generally think if consumers <i>want</i> to use a web product, they would get another browser to do so and <i>stop using Chrome</i> in the same way we got 40% of people to drop IE for Firefox.<p>And finally, Google also doesn&#x27;t have any agreements with Amazon. That is why you have to manually download their app store APK, and why it doesn&#x27;t have first class installation support as a generic app like the Play Store. But Amazon is also making their own Android devices <i>without</i> Gapps, and Samsung is in a position to at least <i>try</i> it themselves if they wanted to, since they have their own app suite as well. And all Google does is require that <i>all</i> their apps be installed if a manufacturer wants to include any of them - which while heavy handed isn&#x27;t anticompetitive to do.<p>If anything, a real domain of monopoly exploit by Google is how they will punish companies they disagree with in SEO, when they <i>do</i> have an overwhelming majority of the search market, and it has been proven in the last 2 decades of business that consumers treat Google like gospel - if its not there, it might as well not exist. People don&#x27;t try using alternative search engines if they don&#x27;t find what they are looking for on Google.<p>&gt; Android is an example of an inferior product succeeding through monopoly control.<p>Android is first mover advantage. It has the same vicious feedback loop that gives Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc their monopolies - they act as middle men to third party products and services, and by capturing the audience capture the mindshare of retailers. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its user and app developers, users and websites, users and friends of them, or users and actual goods retailers - each one has dominance in their market because they have the mindshare.<p>I don&#x27;t see how Google is being particularly abusive with how they run Android. Nobody <i>has to</i> use their Play Store, and nobody <i>has to</i> develop against the Play Services thus bonding their app to the Google Suite. It is just consumers <i>want</i> the apps on <i>that</i> store, so developers use the services and ignore the competition and create a self fulfilling prophecy of monopoly.<p>And I&#x27;m not arguing Android doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly - just Google isn&#x27;t really exploiting it by only requiring all their apps come if someone wants the Play Store. The OS itself is liberally licensed, and anyone could either reuse Dalvik or write their own implementation to run APKs.

2017-06-05 10:52:12,"As a &quot;user&quot;, I love logging in with social media. How awesome is it that I can just click a button and be logged in instantly? No worrying about setting up a password, at least, for most websites. I used to not trust it, but after becoming a developer and learning: it is just grabbing an email or a name is not too bad. Though sometimes, it may grab more than that, such as your friends list, etc. Somehow, that became okay and no one cares.<p>As a &quot;developer&quot;, things are quite different. There are a few libraries of code on Github and you can find examples across the Internet. For the most part, these examples do work after you have set up some API backend on the social media platforms themselves.<p>Code would almost seem straightforward. However, it is not always the case, especially, when a social media platform is ever-changing.  For example, last week, someone released a new product on Hacker News and went about his way, only to realize, that people were attempting to login to Facebook, which recently upgraded from SDK 4 to SDK 5. Massive changes occurred. How embarrassing to go live, only for one of your social media buttons not to work? It&#x27;s not his fault, but it&#x27;s Facebook who updated their code so older versions no longer work. Most developers are trying to focus on their own code and make sure it works. Now they have to worry about potential users being unable to access the front door?<p>When I went to update Facebook SDK 4 to SDK 5 on one of my own platforms, using Facebook&#x27;s very example that they provided. I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I ended up removing Facebook from my registration and login screen. The three that remained were Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn.<p>After some careful testing with these three, they work for the most part, except occasionally, if someone logs into Google, and then tries to login again real fast, such as your code not remembering them and keeping them logged in, Google&#x27;s token expires and it won&#x27;t auto-generate a new one, and it creates a problem, an error that you can&#x27;t even catch, so your users are exposed to seeing that error.<p>Twitter, too, seems to have some issues. Using the examples you can easily find on the Internet, and I&#x27;m no genius when it comes to this stuff, but I managed to copy some code, put it together, and make it work with my database, this would also come with problems: It keeps looping and acquiring a new oauth token without ever going back to my website with the information.  After spending nearly an hour trying to figure out what the problem was and scouring the Internet with very few answers, I gave up. So Twitter has now been removed.<p>LinkedIn is my last resort, but to offer only one option: is it better at all?<p>The purpose of social media logins was to making logging in easier, but none of these social media platforms have beginner or even novice developers in mind. If any of the code was to change while your web application is live, than you are screwed, trying to come up with a patch for it. Lest, you might not even find out until someone actually reports it that your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google login isn&#x27;t working. How would you know otherwise, since you probably might only use one or none?<p>I sought to find out: Do we really need to use social media logins? In this day and age, it is supposedly expected. For the most part, researching claims, there is a 60% usage of social media login buttons. But are they necessary? I came across another article from a developer at MailChimp which makes a great point about social logins: while people use them, if people like your application or find it useful, they are going to register and login with a username or email address, regardless of whether you have social media or not.<p>Here is the article: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2F;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2F;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-...</a><p>Navigating to MailChimp&#x27;s registration and login page: there is no social media presence.<p>So I know there are some attempts at making life easier for developers out there, such as Hybridauth Social Login PHP Library ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hybridauth.github.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hybridauth.github.io&#x2F;</a> ), which may do a good job, but I&#x27;ve not used it yet.  There are also other non-free solutions out there in which you pay for a script or a web company to handle it all for you. This too, might be good, but why? Why isn&#x27;t it easier for developers to set up social media buttons?<p>Maybe it is security concerns or whatever, but you would think that as large as these social media platforms are, they&#x27;d be better at giving you the email and username or whatever you need.. and making it easier. After all, it is technically free branding for them that you put on your website.<p>Anyone else struggle with social media login or just give up completely or maybe you found a really easy solution that grants you peace of mind?",Facebook,"quot user quot love log social media awesom click button log instantli worri set password least websit use trust becom develop learn grab email name bad though sometim may grab friend list etc somehow becam okay one care <p> quot ;d evelop quot thing quit differ librari code github find exampl across internet part exampl work set api backend social media platform <p> code would almost seem straightforward howev alway case especi social media platform ever-chang exampl last week someon releas new product hacker news went way realiz peopl attempt login facebook recent upgrad sdk 4 sdk 5 massiv chang occur embarrass go live one social media button work #x27 fault #x27 facebook updat code older version longer work develop tri focu code make sure work worri potenti user unabl access front door <p> went updat facebook sdk 4 sdk 5 one platform use facebook #x27 exampl provid #x27 get work end remov facebook registr login screen three remain googl twitter linkedin <p> care test three work part except occasion someon log googl tri login real fast code rememb keep log googl #x27 token expir #x27 auto-gener new one creat problem error #x27 even catch user expos see error <p> twitter seem issu use exampl easili find internet #x27 geniu come stuff manag copi code put togeth make work databas would also come problem keep loop acquir new oauth token without ever go back websit inform spend nearli hour tri figur problem scour internet answer gave twitter remov <p> linkedin last resort offer one option better <p> purpos social media login make log easier none social media platform beginn even novic develop mind code chang web applic live screw tri come patch lest might even find someon actual report facebook twitter linkedin googl login #x27 work would know otherwis sinc probabl might use one none <p> sought find realli need use social media login day age supposedli expect part research claim 60 usag social media login button necessari came across anoth articl develop mailchimp make great point social login peopl use peopl like applic find use go regist login usernam email address regardless whether social media <p> articl <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;blog.mailchimp.com&#x2f;social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it&#x2f;"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f blog mailchimp com #x2f social-login-buttons-arent-worth </a> <p> navig mailchimp #x27 registr login page social media presenc <p> know attempt make life easier develop hybridauth social login php librari <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;hybridauth.github.io&#x2f;"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f hybridauth github io #x2f </a> may good job #x27 use yet also non-fre solut pay script web compani handl might good #x27 easier develop set social media button <p> mayb secur concern whatev would think larg social media platform #x27 ;d better give email usernam whatev need make easier technic free brand put websit <p> anyon els struggl social media login give complet mayb found realli easi solut grant peac mind",0.157012432012432,0.3143809893809893

It&#x27;s worth pointing out the authors released codemods which will likely be able to convert your app from one version of the library to the next as long as you don&#x27;t do something exceptionally clever.<p>The changes between 0.x and v1 were entirely expected. It seems the authors followed the common semantics that 0.x releases are considered experimental, v1 was based on the lessons learned. v2 and v3 then improved upon that design with relatively minor changes.<p>On the other hand v4 is an entirely new library using an entirely different paradigm: routes use component semantics and are part of the component structure, rather than just some JS router that uses JSX syntax for aesthetics.<p>But as I said: v3 is still being actively maintained, the authors have just decided that the v4 API fits React better. And for all major releases from v1 to v3 you should be able to upgrade practically for free by using codemods.<p>I think the importance of codemods can not be understated though many people are still ignorant of them: Facebook releases codemods for every major version of React and uses them internally to upgrade their tens of thousands of components automatically. Third-party libraries like React Router have also started providing them.<p>Codemods written well should allow app developers to migrate breaking API changes in dependencies with practically no development effort.<p>Additionally, like React, React Router seems to have adopted the approach of deprecating APIs in the final release of a major version that is no longer going to be supported so you can upgrade your manually code before moving to the new major version with no fear of things breaking. So when upgrading from v2 to v3 you should be able to upgrade safely by simply upgrading to the latest minor version and fixing any deprecation warnings.<p>Both codemods as well as deprecations of course assume you&#x27;re doing the sensible thing and a) upgrading one major version at a time and b) actually maintaining your project rather than just spending half an hour on it once a year to implement a new feature with no test coverage.<p>Personally I often end up doing the not so sensible thing where I end up having to migrate all third party deps to the latest version once a year or two, but libraries like React and React Router are the least of my worries because they are extremely safe and easy to upgrade -- even to the point where there&#x27;s no need to upgrade beyond React Router v3 unless you also prefer the v4 API.",Facebook,"#x27 fan react router sound like #x27 actual use version even look break chang <p> #x27 actual happen <p> v1 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;reacttraining&#x2f;react-router&#x2f;blob&#x2f;v3&#x2f;upgrade-guides&#x2f;v1.0.0.md"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f github com #x2f reacttrain #x2f react-rout #x2f blob #x2f v3 #x2f upgrad </a> <p> v2 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;reacttraining&#x2f;react-router&#x2f;blob&#x2f;v3&#x2f;upgrade-guides&#x2f;v2.0.0.md"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f github com #x2f reacttrain #x2f react-rout #x2f blob #x2f v3 #x2f upgrad </a> <p> v3 mostli remov api deprec v2 v3 continu maintain even beyond v4 0.0 releas <p> v4 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;reacttraining&#x2f;react-router&#x2f;blob&#x2f;master&#x2f;packages&#x2f;react-router&#x2f;docs&#x2f;guides&#x2f;migrating.md"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f github com #x2f reacttrain #x2f react-rout #x2f blob #x2f master #x2f ;p </a> <p> opinion would clearer react-rout v4 releas differ name guess author #x27 want pay cost <p> api chang 1 2 well 2 3 mostli cosmet #x27 worth point author releas codemod like abl convert app one version librari next long #x27 someth except clever <p> chang 0 x v1 entir expect seem author follow common semant 0 x releas consid experiment v1 base lesson learn v2 v3 improv upon design rel minor chang <p> hand v4 entir new librari use entir differ paradigm rout use compon semant part compon structur rather js router use jsx syntax aesthet <p> said v3 still activ maintain author decid v4 api fit react better major releas v1 v3 abl upgrad practic free use codemod <p> think import codemod underst though mani peopl still ignor facebook releas codemod everi major version react use intern upgrad ten thousand compon automat third-parti librari like react router also start provid <p> codemod written well allow app develop migrat break api chang depend practic develop effort <p> addit like react react router seem adopt approach deprec api final releas major version longer go support upgrad manual code move new major version fear thing break upgrad v2 v3 abl upgrad safe simpli upgrad latest minor version fix deprec warn <p> codemod well deprec cours assum #x27 sensibl thing upgrad one major version time b actual maintain project rather spend half hour year implement new featur test coverag <p> person often end sensibl thing end migrat third parti dep latest version year two librari like react react router least worri extrem safe easi upgrad even point #x27 need upgrad beyond react router v3 unless also prefer v4 api",0.09911221590909092,0.4332386363636364

2017-05-16 10:12:09,"I&#x27;m going to go the other way on the SQL advice, even though the author has clarified below that he was talking about prepared statements.<p>It doesn&#x27;t cost me much, if any, developer time to work with stored procedures. I realize most full stack devs don&#x27;t have as much in-depth experience with SQL. That was literally all I did for the first several years of my career. Before it ever occurred to me to learn other programming languages and. It was pure SQL all day every day.<p>If you have the resources to implement even half of this checklist, you probably have the resources to go whole hog on stored procs.<p>I sometimes do this, and sometimes don&#x27;t. Partly, it&#x27;s because I need to stay current with ORMs for the sake of potential job opportunities. And partially because it can be more convenient to keep my head in one language for fleshing out an idea. But for serious projects, I&#x27;ll go the stored proc route.<p>In that kind of scenario, I think of the database as a type of microservice that&#x27;s completely separate from the application layer. You write in the most performant language for that service, even if it&#x27;s different for the main language the app is written in. And you reap the benefits of the database optimizing the procs as well as the database handling transactions instead of trying to manage that in your application.<p>How much of a burden this is boils down to whether you personally have the chops (or someone on the team does), and if you get your shit together when it comes to deployment. Stored Proc code should be saved in text files under version control, and your deploy process should make updates to the procs automatically.<p>If you do things this way, it&#x27;s not any more painful than versioning your database with migrations, which I do on every project, no matter how small. Using stored procs doesn&#x27;t have to mean you&#x27;re working with a mess of unmanageable database code. You can use SQL Alchemy to create models and relationships, Alembic (just speaking to the Python world here), and use a thin wrapper around executing the stored proc, and it&#x27;s really not that much different from writing prepared statements in Alchemy.<p>In principle, it&#x27;s really not different from writing a web app that provides an API that your front end hits (a Python app that resents REST for Angular to call or something else equally common). In this case, I&#x27;m just pushing the API down one layer in the stack.<p>People can argue that the logic that applies to the data should be kept with the logic that defines the data--i.e., that if your model defines the shape of the date, your code that defines its behavior should reside there as well: in the model definition. So the ORM is the correct place for that. Methods on the Class object. I&#x27;m sympathetic to that argument, but I also disagree with it, sort of.<p>I think the rules that govern the behavior of data should exist where the data exists rather than any abstraction layer. Otherwise you have to rewrite them for every new thing that wants to access the data.<p>And every useful application that people use involving data is going to serve that data to more than the first application you designed to work with it. Keeping these rules in sync across even a very minimal web app that consists only of the app itself, an API, and an analytics platform is already some overhead.<p><i>And</i>, every data-driven application already has two means of interface regardless of whether you intend that or not: direct database manipulation. That is going to happen sometimes, whether you want it or not or how bad a practice it is. If there are rules about how things should behave (there are always rules about how things should behave) you have to enforce them at the database level.<p>If you&#x27;re doing that correctly already, there&#x27;s really not that much overhead in using stored procedures. Going that route means that every connection to a database for a certain dataset means that there is a single source of truth for that dataset. Execute procedure x to get data y. That&#x27;s all any developer on any service needs to know.<p>It also makes the idea of minimum privilege easier to manage. You don&#x27;t have to grant select on a table for the API user, for example. You can grant execute to the set of procs that user needs, and only those procs are accessible. Combine that with some well-thought views, and you can greatly limit your attack surface. If someone breaches part of your system and manages to obtain so source code, they don&#x27;t get any real information about the structure of your database. They only get conn.execute(&#x27;check_valid_user&#x27;) or whatever.<p>The obvious problem here is versioning APIs. Which you must always do. So you have to version your stored procs when there are breaking changes. But the overhead in adding a _v1 or _v1.1 to the end of an .sql file for a proc really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal compared to all the other stuff you have to do when maintaining an API.<p>Again, I&#x27;m sympathetic to objections to this model. It is not perfect, and I&#x27;ve never once tried to inflict it on coworkers who want to do things differently. I&#x27;ll do this in my own projects, and when I&#x27;ve gone into a company that&#x27;s already working with that mindset. I don&#x27;t hold up the train based on philosophical differences.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of criticism I agree with that SOA is not a good place to start. It carries a lot of overhead, and you shouldn&#x27;t go there until you need to. But to me, the reality is that any web app that comprises a data store, a controller layer, and a front end is already by definition SOA--not the monolith that you want to think of it as. And therefore you should treat it as such and give the various components the attention they deserve.<p>If you&#x27;re working on a project you have reasonable expectation will be used enough to require some scaling, this is a totally acceptable way to do things. Let the database do what it&#x27;s best at, let the controller layer do what it&#x27;s best at, and then use the front end that&#x27;s best for your use case.<p>Because this response isn&#x27;t long enough already, I&#x27;ll just add this. I don&#x27;t think the MVC model is really appropriate for web apps. Even the modified MVVC model is still weird to me. It seems like a model we shoehorned onto what a web app really is. To me, the web app model is data, logic, presentation. The data layer comprises both the data and the rules about the data. The logic layer dictates what happens when an event is triggered by the presentation layer. And it should be relatively thin, particularly when working with one of the slower languages like Python or Ruby. The presentation layer simply defines the user interface and sends messages to the logic layer.<p>These things really are decoupled by nature in ways they aren&#x27;t necessarily in native or desktop apps or mobile apps. I think that web developers need to understand that this model really doesn&#x27;t fit very well. And behave accordingly.<p>There are obviously exceptions to everything I&#x27;m saying here. But the exceptions come at very large scales. Most apps that start out as MVC web apps on whatever stack are not going to become Facebook or Reddit and are not going to have the specific problems that come with that level of scale.<p>Even so, I would encourage people to rethink what web apps are, and what the MVC&#x2F;MVVC model really means. I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right model, and the decisions we make about architecture are generally not good ones.<p>Finally, since this is so long now, I want to point out that I didn&#x27;t generate these ideas all on my own. I&#x27;ve been heavily influenced by Lex de Haan and Toon Kopplaars in their book, <i>Applied Mathematics for Database Professionals</i>.",Facebook,#x27 go go way sql advic even though author clarifi talk prepar statement <p> #x27 cost much develop time work store procedur realiz full stack dev #x27 much in-depth experi sql liter first sever year career ever occur learn program languag pure sql day everi day <p> resourc implement even half checklist probabl resourc go whole hog store proc <p> sometim sometim #x27 partli #x27 need stay current orm sake potenti job opportun partial conveni keep head one languag flesh idea seriou project #x27 go store proc rout <p> kind scenario think databas type microservic #x27 complet separ applic layer write perform languag servic even #x27 differ main languag app written reap benefit databas optim proc well databas handl transact instead tri manag applic <p> much burden boil whether person chop someon team get shit togeth come deploy store proc code save text file version control deploy process make updat proc automat <p> thing way #x27 pain version databas migrat everi project matter small use store proc #x27 mean #x27 work mess unmanag databas code use sql alchemi creat model relationship alemb speak python world use thin wrapper around execut store proc #x27 realli much differ write prepar statement alchemi <p> principl #x27 realli differ write web app provid api front end hit python app resent rest angular call someth els equal common case #x27 push api one layer stack <p> peopl argu logic appli data kept logic defin data--i e model defin shape date code defin behavior resid well model definit orm correct place method class object #x27 sympathet argument also disagre sort <p> think rule govern behavior data exist data exist rather abstract layer otherwis rewrit everi new thing want access data <p> everi use applic peopl use involv data go serv data first applic design work keep rule sync across even minim web app consist app api analyt platform alreadi overhead <p> <i> </i> everi data-driven applic alreadi two mean interfac regardless whether intend direct databas manipul go happen sometim whether want bad practic rule thing behav alway rule thing behav enforc databas level <p> #x27 correctli alreadi #x27 realli much overhead use store procedur go rout mean everi connect databas certain dataset mean singl sourc truth dataset execut procedur x get data #x27 develop servic need know <p> also make idea minimum privileg easier manag #x27 grant select tabl api user exampl grant execut set proc user need proc access combin well-thought view greatli limit attack surfac someon breach part system manag obtain sourc code #x27 get real inform structur databas get conn execut #x27 check_valid_us #x27 ;) whatev <p> obviou problem version api must alway version store proc break chang overhead ad _v1 _v1 1 end sql file proc realli #x27 big deal compar stuff maintain api <p> #x27 sympathet object model perfect #x27 never tri inflict cowork want thing differ #x27 project #x27 gone compani #x27 alreadi work mindset #x27 hold train base philosoph differ <p> #x27 lot critic agre soa good place start carri lot overhead #x27 go need realiti web app compris data store control layer front end alreadi definit soa--not monolith want think therefor treat give variou compon attent deserv <p> #x27 work project reason expect use enough requir scale total accept way thing let databas #x27 best let control layer #x27 best use front end #x27 best use case <p> respons #x27 long enough alreadi #x27 add #x27 think mvc model realli appropri web app even modifi mvvc model still weird seem like model shoehorn onto web app realli web app model data logic present data layer compris data rule data logic layer dictat happen event trigger present layer rel thin particularli work one slower languag like python rubi present layer simpli defin user interfac send messag logic layer <p> thing realli decoupl natur way #x27 necessarili nativ desktop app mobil app think web develop need understand model realli #x27 fit well behav accordingli <p> obvious except everyth #x27 say except come larg scale app start mvc web app whatev stack go becom facebook reddit go specif problem come level scale <p> even would encourag peopl rethink web app mvc #x2f mvvc model realli mean realli #x27 think #x27 right model decis make architectur gener good one <p> final sinc long want point #x27 gener idea #x27 heavili influenc lex de haan toon kopplaar book <i> appli mathemat databas profession </i>,0.08079906204906205,0.4825466971300305
2017-05-10 21:58:24,"In comparison to the other garbage, yeah it might be the winner. But it&#x27;s still garbage.<p>I was one of the first users of the beta program. At the time, Ludvig&#x27;s philosophy of simplicity + hidden functionality via interactive views shone through the UI and it was very pleasant to use. The 5 star rating system was the icing on the cake. A step down in functionality from Amarok&#x27;s playlist creation system, and lacking the fine search and organization capabilities of foobar2000, but it did the job.<p>However, the UX of Spotify has hideously morphed over time. Now the UI mostly uses Chromium Embedded Framework which brings huge overhead and causes lots of rendering latency. The font size and padding has grown, then shrunk, then grown again, each time showing less tracks on a page at once. Views that were once interactive with left and right clicks became static. Star ratings turned into Like&#x2F;Unlike.<p>Their user behavior tracking has naturally been cranked up to 11, though it is better than a lot of similar products, I still have no desire for a music service to track anything other than the music I search and play.

I like a music player that puts <i>me</i> in charge of the UI.<p>I no longer pay for Spotify and have returned to getting my music through other means.<p>On my Linux and Windows machines, I mostly use foobar2000 and VLC, and Amarok when I need powerful playlisting tools.

2017-05-01 20:37:17,"Thank you for your comment. Let me tell you a few pros:<p>- You can integrate Google and Facebook directly, or integrate Ukey1 and get all in one.<p>- Especially with Facebook, you need to follow API changes, but if you have Ukey1 - you don&#x27;t need to care about it - we care. For example a week ago, one of my friends told me that Facebook changed something and since that time FB login doesn&#x27;t work on his website - he still waits for his developers to fix it). Other example - pixabay.com - their FB login doesn&#x27;t work at least for 6 months.<p>- There are people who don&#x27;t want to use social logins. If you don&#x27;t want to loose those users, you need to implement email&#x2F;password option as well. It means, you need to store passwords in your database and care about authentication. Ukey1 offers social logins (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn) as well as classic email&#x2F;password option. It means, no barriers.<p>- As a user, with Ukey1 you have absolutely full control over your personal data you share. It&#x27;s not possible with Google or Facebook. And this is just a beginning.<p>- As a user, you can merge all your social identities. Why? For example, very often I have a problem that after some time I can&#x27;t remember what social account I previously used on different websites. And I am not alone.<p>- And finally, are you familiar with new General Data Protection Regulation in EU? If you collect personal data about European citizens, you should.

2017-02-22 15:59:49,"Last couple of years or so have been an eye opener for me on how I choose libraries, tools and services for my project. One important lesson was that never choose a service which don&#x27;t have plug and play open source alternative. Even hyped start ups go out of business and big companies like Facebook and Google shut down services.<p>Third party APIs are a even bigger risk. Facebook and Twitter APIs used to change quite often 2-3 years ago. (Haven&#x27;t personally worked on this off late though.) APIs and services which seem too cheap are generally the ones which should be avoided. Because it is more likely that the companies running these will not find a sustainable business model.<p>Even Open Source projects get abandoned quite often. Sometimes a team puts together an impressive open source project and then they get acquired by a big company which results in abandonment of the project. I have one client who has his startup riding on Kurento Media Server for WebRTC calls. This product is in development from last one and half years.

Then, you choose a filter, tune the filter, and after some processing, your result is ready.<p>- The finished image can be saved on the device, or exported directly to Instagram or Facebook.<p>- Recently, their camera gained a new button, to livestream to Facebook instead. The filters can be changed at any time during the broadcast.<p>- Facebook has revoked their API access to this livestream feature.<p>- Facebook is indeed working on style transfer for live video [1].<p>So this wasn&#x27;t the case of a third-party app <i>depending</i> on a big platform&#x27;s APIs and playing within their own walled garden. Rather, it&#x27;s a related, but different case of betting on the tech instead of the community [2], effectively being a free tech demo and hoping to attract investor interest.<p>While this may still work, the concept was quickly copied, -- in some cases, deliberately, like in the case of VK&#x27;s Vinci [3].

2016-11-15 09:15:51,"You don’t need any of this stuff to build a great web app. You don’t need react, you don’t need fancy javascript syntax that requires you have a complicated build infrastructure. Babel has over 40,000 files. Think about that for a moment. 40k files for some shorthand syntax. Your &quot;build&quot; times may only be a few seconds now (anything that is over one second imo is too long), but just wait. They will get to 30+ seconds in no time and then you&#x27;ll have to go dive into the belly of that 40k file beast to find out how to unfuck yourself. I&#x27;ve been there.<p>You don’t even need a framework most of the time. Most of the frameworks I’ve used are poorly designed (I&#x27;m looking at you Ember. If there are any Ember devs reading this, I&#x27;ll meet you in the parking lot...) and represent the design choices of a someone working on some project probably a lot different than yours. It feels good to give up control and let someone else make some choices for you, until you realize you’ve built an application based upon their poor design, and then you’re stuck.<p>All you need is semantic HTML, the DOM, and some plain old javascript. Organize your code, write simply, don’t overcomplicate and try to make things too general because your problems probably are very likely concrete anyway. Don’t buy into the hype. Just because big company X uses something, doesn’t mean you need to use it on your projects too. Have you seen Facebook? Their product hasn’t changed or innovated appreciably in years so you shouldn’t be taking any lessons from them in how to build ‘scalable’ applications, whatever that means.<p>Don’t dump a 500 KB framework on the page to save a few milliseconds in incremental rendering. Or think you need to worry about performance or complexity before you even have an app.<p>Is it odd to anyone that the entire battle cry of React is rooted in pre-optimization? The myth that the DOM is somehow evil, or all pages will one day have millions of elements to manage? This is gladly spoonfed to people who don&#x27;t understand how the browser works, and never learned the basics. Take away their framework and they don&#x27;t know how to build apps!<p>It violates my sense of pragmatism to save a few ms in rendering when you delay the initial page load by 500 ms or more? I also personally find the mixing of declarative and imperative programming styles and JSX to be absolutely horrid and the debug experience of many of the immutable libraries to be terrible. And, if you actually performance test the stuff you&#x27;ll see they are full of either outright lies or fabrications to make the authors look good. Hint: if every time you call a getter on an object it causes the framework to go 30 stacks deep you&#x27;re not going to have good performance. Just try it in your framework of choice today. You&#x27;re swear we&#x27;re working in java these days with the stack traces so deep and abstracted they have lost all touch with reality.<p>My favorite recently is to find all kinds of bizarre wrappers for javascript libraries that could have been used well enough on their own.

And if you want wildcards or a &gt;90 day length (regardless of what you think of their security, many people do -- the biggest sites on the internet have both), that means paying money. And it also still leaves you vulnerable to MitM rogue CA attacks.<p>HPKP requires the user to connect the first time to get the pinned key. If an MitM has a fake certificate for your domain, they can send that to you on your first connection and fool you. DANE does not have this problem.<p>Well, to be fair, DANE has it for the DNSSEC provider used. But that is one thing to trust, and said certificate can be bundled with the OS or browser. One thing to trust beats the current 2000+ intermediate CAs we have to trust.<p>Further, DANE allows a way to verify self-signed certificates, allowing security to be free for everyone. We could see a lot more innovation than just certbot if Let&#x27;s Encrypt weren&#x27;t the only way to generate free certificates. For just one example, web servers could generate certificates from fresh installs; zero configuration requied. Like Caddy, but in nginx and Apache.<p>Lastly, HPKP is riskier. You have to include a backup pin. But, what would happen if your had your own pinned, and StartSSL as the secondary? And you set HPKP for a year? And two weeks from now, Mozilla revokes StartCom entirely? Well, good luck with that one. Deleting HPKP is a royal pain for a regular user (about:permissions in Firefox, chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;net-internals#hsts in Chrome)<p>&gt; We also have pre-loaded pinning in Chrome for larger or more obvious targets.<p>Nice for Google and Facebook, not so nice for byuu.org =(<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also worth noting that CryptoCat has committed pinning-suicide in Chrome at at the moment due to their CA having switched intermediates between renewals.<p>Another good negative of HPKP.<p>&gt; But support for that was removed because it was a bunch of parsing code outside of the sandbox, wasn&#x27;t really being used and it conflicted with two long-term plans for the health of the HTTPS ecosystem: eliminating 1024-bit RSA and Certificate Transparency. The conflicts are probably the most important reasons for not wanting to renew the experiment.<p>RSA-1024 is bad, yes. Perhaps we should start asking how we can get DNSSEC on RSA-2048+. Having a commitment to implement it in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari if we do would go a long way toward making that happen, I&#x27;m sure. Further, we can reject any RSA-1024 signed DNSSEC after that point, just like we reject weak crypto in browsers today.<p>If they can&#x27;t change DNSSEC to stronger crypto, how about they make an alternative? If Google introduces one that has stronger crypto, supports it in Chrome, and offers a free &quot;DNSSEC+&quot; hosting service, I&#x27;ll definitely take immediate advantage of that.<p>But the latter is the whole point of DANE -- self-signing. Certificate Transparency is a crutch due to the CA system having 2000+ intermediate CAs that can sign any domain name they want. With DANE, you don&#x27;t need that anymore. DANE is about providing an alternative to the CA signing business.<p>And there&#x27;s nothing stopping users from serving up trusted CA-signed endpoint certificate signatures over DANE&#x2F;TLSA records. That would obviously remain the only sensible way to do EV certificates. The way I see it, a DANE certificate would act like HTTP does now: you get the globe (or even the question mark circle), but your page actually loads over HTTPS, instead of sending you to Defcon-1 advisories that are all but impossible for the casual user to work around (and indeed, we don&#x27;t want to train them to work around these warnings anyway.) There&#x27;s no way this would be <i>worse</i> than plain-text HTTP.<p>&gt; You literally can&#x27;t avoid it because the root zone transits through a 1024-bit key.<p>Does this really matter for the root? There are root CAs with RSA-1024 still.<p>...<p>At any rate, Google apparently feels DNSSEC+DANE is good enough for this web service API. So, honest question, why offer that if it&#x27;s really such an unworkable system?",Facebook,"thank link previous work link <p> <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.ietf.org&#x2f;mail-archive&#x2f;web&#x2f;dane&#x2f;current&#x2f;msg06996.html"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f www ietf org #x2f mail-arch #x2f web #x2f ;d ane #x2f current #x2f msg 06996 </a> <p> <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2f;show_bug.cgi?id=1077323"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f bugzilla mozilla org #x2f show_bug cgi id 1077323 </a> <p> <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;bugs.chromium.org&#x2f;p&#x2f;chromium&#x2f;issues&#x2f;detail?id=50874"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f bug chromium org #x2f ;p #x2f chromium #x2f issu #x2f ;d etail id 50874 </a> <p> gt instead hpkp memory-bas pin solut use http header <p> problem hpkp still need certif ca want wildcard gt 90 day length regardless think secur mani peopl biggest site internet mean pay money also still leav vulner mitm rogu ca attack <p> hpkp requir user connect first time get pin key mitm fake certif domain send first connect fool dane problem <p> well fair dane dnssec provid use one thing trust said certif bundl os browser one thing trust beat current 2000 intermedi ca trust <p> dane allow way verifi self-sign certif allow secur free everyon could see lot innov certbot let #x27 encrypt #x27 way gener free certif one exampl web server could gener certif fresh instal zero configur requi like caddi nginx apach <p> lastli hpkp riskier includ backup pin would happen pin startssl secondari set hpkp year two week mozilla revok startcom entir well good luck one delet hpkp royal pain regular user :p ermiss firefox chrome #x2f #x2f net-intern #hst chrome <p> gt also pre-load pin chrome larger obviou target <p> nice googl facebook nice byuu org =( <p> gt #x27 also worth note cryptocat commit pinning-suicid chrome moment due ca switch intermedi renew <p> anoth good neg hpkp <p> gt support remov bunch pars code outsid sandbox #x27 realli use conflict two long-term plan health http ecosystem elimin 1024 bit rsa certif transpar conflict probabl import reason want renew experi <p> rsa 1024 bad ye perhap start ask get dnssec rsa 2048 commit implement chrome firefox edg safari would go long way toward make happen #x27 sure reject rsa 1024 sign dnssec point like reject weak crypto browser today <p> #x27 chang dnssec stronger crypto make altern googl introduc one stronger crypto support chrome offer free quot ;D nssec quot host servic #x27 definit take immedi advantag <p> latter whole point dane self-sign certif transpar crutch due ca system 2000 intermedi ca sign domain name want dane #x27 need anymor dane provid altern ca sign busi <p> #x27 noth stop user serv trust ca-sign endpoint certif signatur dane #x2f tlsa record would obvious remain sensibl way ev certif way see dane certif would act like http get globe even question mark circl page actual load http instead send defcon 1 advisori imposs casual user work around inde #x27 want train work around warn anyway #x27 way would <i> wors </i> plain-text http <p> gt liter #x27 avoid root zone transit 1024 bit key <p> realli matter root root ca rsa 1024 still <p> <p> rate googl appar feel dnssec dane good enough web servic api honest question offer #x27 realli unwork system",0.13146929824561404,0.6103941745389114
2016-09-27 07:00:07,"Yeah. That&#x27;s a good articulation of some of the problems but that&#x27;s tough to learn them the hard way. I wrote a comment below talking a bit about how a lot of these problems start to go away with Exponent but I wanted to offer some thoughts if you or your teammates have embarked on the raw React Native route.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve learned from working with React Native is that you want to stay fairly up to date with the frequent releases. The Exponent team puts a lot of work into upgrading our own dependencies and maintaining the Exponent API that other developers depend on.<p>Authors of components and other npm packages will update their code to work with the latest version of React Native. It takes energy to stay up to date since you need to read the release notes and breaking changes and sometimes it&#x27;s helpful to scan the commit history on the release branch. But this way you can use react-redux v4 and other actively developed dependencies.<p>On the other hand, though, sometimes component authors don&#x27;t maintain their projects or support one platform but not the other. When dependencies fall out of date there isn&#x27;t an easy answer. In the past I&#x27;ve fixed the issues myself and sent pull requests. Showing financial support is also another approach; my teammate Brent wrote a post about this: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.getexponent.com&#x2F;putting-your-money-where-your-package-json-is-e34a35099a1b"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.getexponent.com&#x2F;putting-your-money-where-your-p...</a>. The maintenance of open-source libraries isn&#x27;t unique to React Native but it&#x27;s perhaps exacerbated by its cross-platform nature and frequent release cycle.<p>For the issue about CPU ABIs, I believe React Native supports armeabi-v7a and x86 but not arm64-v8a or x64. It would be great to have native arm64 support but so far no one has needed it enough to implement it instead of using ndk.abiFilters. For what it&#x27;s worth, this works for Exponent and several other companies with apps that use React Native like Facebook.",Facebook,"yeah #x27 good articul problem #x27 tough learn hard way wrote comment talk bit lot problem start go away expon want offer thought teammat embark raw react nativ rout <p> one thing #x27 learn work react nativ want stay fairli date frequent releas expon team put lot work upgrad depend maintain expon api develop depend <p> author compon npm packag updat code work latest version react nativ take energi stay date sinc need read releas note break chang sometim #x27 help scan commit histori releas branch way use react-redux v4 activ develop depend <p> hand though sometim compon author #x27 maintain project support one platform depend fall date #x27 easi answer past #x27 fix issu sent pull request show financi support also anoth approach teammat brent wrote post <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;blog.getexponent.com&#x2f;putting-your-money-where-your-package-json-is-e34a35099a1b"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f blog getexpon com #x2f ;p utting-your-money-where-your-p </a> mainten open-sourc librari #x27 uniqu react nativ #x27 perhap exacerb cross-platform natur frequent releas cycl <p> issu cpu abi believ react nativ support armeabi-v 7 x86 arm 64 v8a x64 would great nativ arm 64 support far one need enough implement instead use ndk abifilt #x27 worth work expon sever compani app use react nativ like facebook",0.11988960113960116,0.5447115384615384
2016-09-26 18:02:46,"Hi there! I work on Exponent.<p>We intentionally chose to not let users drop down to native -- the idea of having an interpreted language that sits on top of a native runtime on multiple platforms is not a new one, and it allows for so many benefits that you lose out on if developers can add arbitrary compiled code with direct access to system APIs.<p>Additionally, there is a significant value-add of using Exponent in terms of upgrades. As great as React Native is, it also moves extremely fast and it can be difficult to keep up with new releases -- a change in React Native might cause several of your native dependencies to break, and you&#x27;ll need to fork those libraries and fix them if the maintainer isn&#x27;t keeping on the same schedule as you. Updates with Exponent are as simple as updating JavaScript, which has much less churn and breaking changes than the native side (the React API itself is very mature, the APIs for specific native components may change).<p>Another nice advantage of this is that you can work on an iOS app from Windows and Linux, because you don&#x27;t need to compile your app with Xcode (we handle builds for you when you want to ship to the app store, before that you can just use the Exponent client).<p>We ship with a bunch of APIs out of the box and are constantly improving them and adding more. We have analytics tools like Amplitude and Segment built in, Maps, Facebook login (working on Google Login), and more: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.getexponent.com&#x2F;versions&#x2F;latest&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.getexponent.com&#x2F;versions&#x2F;latest&#x2F;index.html</a><p>React Native is still very early, though, and Exponent is just a small team of seven, so we understand that we can&#x27;t possibly expose every API that developers working with the platform might want. So, we are working on a way for developers to be able to still take advantage of the Exponent toolchain and layer on native code.

Our department had a good 300 developers, and had been writing code for years. They had built the whose system using the classic, box-box-cylinder architecture. There were hundreds of little top tier &#x27;services&#x27;, but in practice, they all shared the same database, had to be deployed pretty much at the same time, and version upgrades had to go in lockstep. Every so often, database changes were necessary, and the world would grind to a halt for months to make the system still work after the migration: It was awful.<p>On top of this, having everyone using one stack really meant that a council of elders got to make tech decisions, and everyone else just did what they were told. This built a giant hierarchy. People near the top would never leave, because nowhere else would give them that much power. Talented developers would take years to gain influence, so they often just left. What remained was developers with no ambitions other than getting a paycheck... it was horrible.<p>The alternative was to let people maintain their own stacks, as long as they provided interfaces that other people could call. By limiting how much code could talk to a database, you didn&#x27;t need negotiations to change something: Teams made any change they wanted as long as they remained backwards compatible, and then had to lobby users to upgrade to newest API versions if they wanted to remove the backwards compatibility mess. It was awesome in comparison.<p>A gigantic place won&#x27;t have those problems, because they can invest money on making whatever tech decisions they made tenable: PHP is slow?

It&#x27;s not the cliche of CRUD LOB vs. &quot;Cool things&quot;, but of making apps targeted at the end user vs. creating a shared infrastructure (whether it is a library or a cloud service), and there are many levels down that rabbit hole.<p>But that being said, Unless you are working for a very conventional small or midsize business with no plans of rapid growth (and businesses of these rarely employ large teams that need leadership anyway), it&#x27;s never going to be &quot;just CRUD&quot; or just slapping a client GUI in front o a database backend&quot;. With large datasets or many users you have to plan your storage and query patterns for scalability, when precision is crucial you have to design for consistency when a real-time response is required you need to reduce latency and when business requirements change often you need to design for flexibility, when your company has multiple clients you need to design a good API, and so on. In most cases you must balance between several requirements, and I haven&#x27;t even gotten to security yet, which is a too often neglected requirement for almost every system out there. I also didn&#x27;t touch all the peripheral requirements for having automated tests (and designing for testability), designing a CI pipeline and educating junior devs about revision control workflows and DevOps practices.<p>Handling all of that doesn&#x27;t require the same technical skills required for writing kernel code, a ray tracing engine or a database engine (all of them different skills in their own respect), but to be able to design a good system and give guidance to junior developers you definitely need more than 2-3 years of experience.<p>Yes, many companies choose to ignore what I&#x27;ve just said, and hire low-level programmers anyway, and often put an MBA (who did some formulas in Excel back then) to (micro-)manage them. Of course the products they turn out are buggy, hard to upgrade, fall down to pieces under the smallest hint of load, end up requiring expensive hardware, have gaping security holes and all-in-all cost their failings end up costing the business dearly.<p>This blasé approach to group 1 development is very common in the so-called &quot;enterprise world&quot;, but that&#x27;s just because the organizational elite over there (as opposed to most of Silicon Valley) is not even tangentially technical.

2016-06-26 23:47:53,"* Disclosure: I used to work for Facebook&#x27;s security team and focused on threats that impacted users on the platform. *<p>The post outlines in some detail a common attack done by some actors known as BePush&#x2F;Killim. I made a request for help in fighting these clowns months ago on a private security working group. Here&#x27;s the post below which outlines a good amount of detail about the hacks and motives. If you are interested in tracking these actors yourself, it&#x27;s pretty easy once you find one of their command and control servers.<p>Example: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.passivetotal.org&#x2F;passive&#x2F;userexperiencestatics.net"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.passivetotal.org&#x2F;passive&#x2F;userexperiencestatics.n...</a><p>From there, we can see the actors are using Cloudflare to obfuscate their infrastructure, but we can make a pivot based on the WhosAmongUs IDs (dsafagegg2 [1] and dsafagegg [2]) in order to find more websites owned by these guys. It&#x27;s a rats nest that extends to hundreds of domains registered weekly. Servers are typically hosted in places where legal action is difficult meaning the attacks seldom stop or go down completely.<p><pre><code>  [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.passivetotal.org&#x2F;trackers&#x2F;WhosAmungUsId&#x2F;dsafagegg2

-----------------------------------------------<p>As promised, below is a quick high-level summary of the malware outlined in the subject. We&#x27;ve been dealing with the malware for months and while some would call is spam, we consider it malware simply because any of the executables or Chrome extensions could be changed to steal passwords, credit cards or every document off a system. We welcome any help in dealing with these actors and would also be interested in new ways to combat malicious extensions, both Chrome and Firefox as those are only increasing in usage.<p>If you would like more information on the technical details of the binaries, extensions or other loaders, feel free to shoot me a message. If there&#x27;s enough interest, I will just spam the list, but would prefer to keep this to the higher level points, so others gain a better understanding of the threat.<p>-= Summary =-<p>BePush is a set of Turkish-based actors who use innovative techniques to spread malicious code and spam through social networking sites and ad-based networks. Those involved in the development of BePush malware are constantly adjusting their TTPs to account for changes in detection or disruption. Actors favor multiple levels of obfuscation through the use of short-url redirectors, third-party hosting providers and multi-stage payloads. Despite high infection rates, local law enforcement has yet to take an interest in pursuing those actors involved.<p>-= Infection Process =-<p>Based on our logs, primary infection processes tend to occur through direct traffic, followed by Facebook and various ad providers. Shortened URL links are shared among users which typically traverse through a series of redirects to a landing page mimicking Facebook infrastructure and using porn as a lure to install a plug-in. Depending on the attacker behavior, payloads may be delivered in the form of a Google Chrome extension (hosted within the store) or through an executable (likely AutoHotkey, but could be Pyinstaller based) that later replaces Chrome with a version of Chromium with their malicious extension.<p>Once installed, malicious code will make use of the Facebook Graph API in order to make requests&#x2F;posts on behalf of the infected user using a stolen access token. In order to establish a high infection count, the malicious code will often create pages with malicious links, post statuses&#x2F;comments to the user&#x27;s friends and spam within certain application pages. Once the spreading routine completes, the process generally begins again with the infected user&#x27;s friends.<p>-= Motives and Capabilities =-<p>It appears the primary motivation for the BePush actors is the money gained through the sale of Facebook likes, followers or various ad-network and affiliate partners. In some cases, Facebook observed BePush actors including a bundled bitcoin miner, but it never appeared to gain much popularity.<p>From a capabilities perspective, actors involved with BePush appear to pay attention to how their code is detected. When numbers begin to dwindle, changes to the code or 3rd-party providers are made. Actors demonstrate a level of understanding in .Net programming, Python, JavaScript and techniques used to detect spam. We have also observed the actors repurposing browser exploits, but we never saw these used against users.<p>-= Third-Party Provider Usage =-<p>BePush favors the use of free and open infrastructure in order to keep their campaigns alive long enough to get a strong infection foothold. The following providers have been observed in some capacity:<p><pre><code>  - Amazon AWS - Used for hosting content
  - Dropbox - Used to host binaries
  - Box.com (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;box.com&#x2F;) - Used to host binaries
  - Bitly - Used for redirection
  - Tinyurl - Used for redirection
  - Godaddy - Used for redirection
  - WhosAmungUs - Used for campaign tracking
  - Stellar - Used for bitcoin wallet hosting
  - Imgur - Used for redirection 
  - Dot.tk - Used for redirection
  - Google - Used for redirection, Chrome extensions and binary hosting
  - CloudFlare - Used to obfuscate real infrastructure
  - Microsoft Azure - Used to host binaries
</code></pre>
-= Detection and Research =-<p>BePush has a limited set of providers they prefer to use and through industry relationships, we have been able to put pressure on the attackers. Here are a couple items we noticed when doing disruption work that helped in making a larger impact against the group.<p>Using passive DNS data to identify other domains sitting on the same IP address (these guys don&#x27;t use a lot of unique servers)
Use ESET (<i>Facebook</i>) or Microsoft (<i>Kilim</i>) AV signatures to identify new binaries being used

2016-06-18 17:43:14,"With JWT, you have the option of stateful or stateless. Stateless gives you cheap federation (any server can authenticate a token issued by another server), but you lose the ability to handle revocation without some sort of statefulness introduced (a redis cache with revoked token ids for example). Stateful is basically a non-cookie based session.<p>One possible alternative to enable auto-renewal is to issue a new token with every request, and manually bake in the persistence of the token into your front end client.<p>In my own system, I have login with facebook, which submits current FB auth tokens with every request, after which I issue my own app token with all the necessary authorization information for my business logic. Whenever the app token expires, I attempt re-authentication using facebook login, and if successful I send back an updated app token. The front end client has logic built in to compare and swap app tokens if they change and persist in sessionStorage.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hacky.

2016-05-28 11:10:45,"I generally see two reactions to the &quot;one codebase to rule them all&quot; approach (used by Facebook, Google, et. al):<p>1. Holy god why would you let your code grow to such a massive, interdependent scale? Just release everything separately and versioned so that breaking changes don&#x27;t affect everyone all at once. The idea of git being a bottleneck is absurd and you are using it wrong.<p>2. This is a very reasonable, practical approach to sharing code across a company. It reduces siloing and ensures that major refactors can happen in one pass without a ton of coordination. Better to fix the version control system than waste endless resources refactoring millions of lines of code.<p>Both reaction is valid. Having worked in both styles of codebase, I recognize that there are trade-offs in either case. The optimal solution depends on the project and the team.<p>Sometimes the path of least resistance--that is to say, the path to getting things shipped and, in turn, making money--is to let the codebase grow organically and worry about cleaning up any messy interdependencies later, once you have a better idea of what code you even need to keep around. In this scenario, it&#x27;s important to recognize that developer efficiency is going to be an uphill battle in the long run, but if you are proactive about maintenance and tooling improvements then this approach can still be relatively painless.<p>Other times, especially when you&#x27;re working on a tried-and-tested product with a clear API and a dedicated team, it can be productive to split it out and let the team manage their own versioning and releases. This becomes especially useful if the product is open source. (For instance, I wonder how Facebook manages its open source releases relative to its shared Mercurial codebase.) In this scenario, developer efficiency is usually less of a problem, as proper use of versioning can ensure faster, more agile updates to each product. But the downside is that your company as a whole can end up in a kind of versioning hell, where every project depends on a different version of every other project, and keeping everything up to date can require a huge amount of coordination.<p>So, in the end, pick your poison.

2016-04-19 17:11:54,"Using custom resources, like LWRPs, doesn&#x27;t provide the same flexibility. Most of the time you fall into making something which works akin to the `cron` internal resource which doesn&#x27;t provide managing an entire system but instead a single entry which means you get neither automatic cleanup nor automatic fall back [to an earlier value]. It also means there&#x27;s no good way to stack configs. You can (obviously) build a resource which manages the entire file&#x2F;subsystem (poise does this, for example), but even then, you don&#x27;t get the ability for everyone to override things later in the run... and we want the final service owner to be able to change anything anyone before them has set. It&#x27;s a key part of being able to scale people... and for us to have such a small core chef team (4-5 people).<p>In addition, using simple hashes and arrays makes it much simpler for your average software engineer to make changes they want - they have to learn little to no Chef in the simple case... even not knowing ruby they can figure out variable assignments.<p>The monolithic repo works well for us given we use grocery-delivery (github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;grocery-delivery). We have no environments (see my ChefConf keynote in 2013 for a full breakdown of how we do run things) and no cookbook versioning... we run directly off of head. We use a combination of taste-tester (github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;taste-tester) for general testing and and sharding (see `node.in_shard?` and `node.in_flexible_shard?` in the `fb_helpers` cookbook) to control the speed of rollout of risky changes.<p>To be clear we use no precedences at all except `default` - using other precedences will in fact likely break our model since it causes the node-read code to merge things rather than treating it like a single hash. The model here is last-writer-wins always.<p>As for tests, people consuming these cookbooks are simply assigning variables, so there&#x27;s not a lot to test in a wrapper cookbook. &quot;Did the attribute get the value I assigned it&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like a useful unittest... that should be covered by Chef&#x27;s unittests itself. For our more complicated cookbooks we&#x27;ve unit-tested the API and where we could we released those (see fb_fstab), and we have some other unittests we haven&#x27;t yet been able to release that hopefully we&#x27;ll come back around to.<p>Hope that helps,

2016-04-17 22:05:44,"As fbonetti already said, LIMIT is the canonical way to do it with SQL databases (I would just add to their comment that you should ensure a positive page_size and offset, because &quot;LIMIT -5&quot; is invalid in at least MySQL, and to limit the page size to some sensible values).<p>For NoSQL, specifically (only?) CouchDB, you start iterating from a given key (in SQL, this would effectively be &quot;WHERE id &gt;= $start ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT n&quot;).<p>This difference is why I would recommend, especially for paginated REST APIs, to provide links to the next&#x2F;prev pages, so API clients can follow these links without thinking about how pagination is accomplished exactly. To prevent people from guessing the inner workings and working around your links, you can encode the parameters in a &quot;cursor&quot; (so instead of ?pagesize=20&amp;page=10 you could have ?cursor=base64encode(&quot;20,10&quot;) (SQL) or ?cursor=base64encode(&quot;$startKey&quot;) (NoSQL)). IIRC Facebook does it this way.

2016-03-30 11:10:18,"React Native (RN) is not for all apps, it has its uses if what your app does is mainly text delivery, example news app. One of the more complicated app that uses React Native is Discord for iOS (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;35309471&#x2F;is-discord-mobile-app-really-built-with-react-native"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;35309471&#x2F;is-discord-mobil...</a>), a Slack like chat app. That was then but I&#x27;m not sure the latest version is still RN heavy. You can actually build a native iOS app, and then add RN as part of your app. The tweet by Discord that said they are using RN is deleted.<p>Some reservations to choose RN: RN is possible due to the JavaScriptCore framework build by Apple. It is the bridge between JavaScript code and Cocoa API. Apple designed this so that you can use JavaScript as scripting language for Cocoa. The popular Sketch for OS X is using the precise JavaScriptCore to power its plug-in scripting feature. I guess Apple never have thought JavaScriptCore could be used the way RN does. Choosing RN means your app is relying on Apple&#x27;s decision on JavaScriptCore API. Someone please enlighten me if RN is still possible or not if Apple remove JavaScriptCore.<p>JavaScriptCore opens up the Cocoa API, but does not give you a JavaScript ready API. So RN has to implement the bridge internally. So when iOS 10 is released, you will have some lag waiting for new features or changes to be supported by RN. I guess this is common problem to all cross-platform framework.<p>In order to implement RN for Android, Facebook implements its own JavaScripCore for Android. I have no Android experience, but what I read is RN app for Android is not performing as natively as its iOS counterpart.<p>If your business rely on all Apple&#x27;s platform, then choosing RN does not help as there is no RN for watchOS and tvOS.<p>React Native will make app manager and web-dev team happy, but not those who treasure the last mile UX experiences. But is could also be useful for those startups creating their first MVP. Get app release fast and then change to native codes when you got the traction.

2016-03-17 00:57:32,"So basically you starts with React in the client. Of course React is new and shiny yet mandates that you do things differently when dealing with mutable data, so you need to adopt Redux.

2016-03-03 16:58:09,"Hi. I know C# in amateur fashion and Go professionally. I think a lot of people here will give you a very positive review of Go. Since they&#x27;ve got that covered, let me tell you what you&#x27;re giving up from C# or F# and why I won&#x27;t use Go. Maybe you can form a balanced conclusion from the aggregates, because I find Go to be very polarizing.<p><i>Concurrency</i><p>Async: Go uses channels for all concurrency. Period. This mechanism, is sort of like half of the Erlang Actor philosophy, but even more lightweight. Channels and goroutines are constantly coming into and out of existence and you feel no real shame doing it. Even simple tasks often need them becuase Go&#x27;s I&#x2F;O libraries tend to be async-first.<p>Compared to C# and F#&#x27;s async, I think you will find this to be very different, but not particularly better in terms of performance. F# offers a very similar abstration with very similar performance characteristics and C# async methods are using a very similar mechanism under the covers to provide closure over computation chains in what amounts to a kind of effectful state monad. Don&#x27;t sell your home team short on this front; MS&#x27;s work there is cutting edge.<p><i>Error Handling</i><p>In daily programming, Go&#x27;s weakest story is error handling. While many people rightly cricisize try-catch error handling as a primitive and error prone mechanism, the Go solution is to say, &quot;We all hate C but actually C erorr handling was fine so long as you have multiple return values at the syntactic level.&quot; So you often return a success value (which is nullable) and an error value (which is nullable) and then ask the caller to check on the null.<p>This is basically error code checking. People will say it isn&#x27;t, but really it is. It really is. And unlike some other langauges Go provides no facilities for &quot;chaining&quot; these operations. So you end up writing if err != nil { ... } over and over.<p>In the case of chained I&#x2F;O operations, this is really tiresome. It also often leads to code repeating or some somewhat convoluted dispatch logic.<p>Go Error values also suffer from Go&#x27;s other issue, it doesn&#x27;t have an extensible type system. Instead it has &quot;interfaces&quot;. In practice, what this means is that it&#x27;s very difficult to expose new error types or give your clients good ways to dispatch on them. While this means error handling code is lightweight, it also often means it has to do silly things like regex and error message string to find out what a specific failure was.<p>Some people value that approach. If you&#x27;re writing an executable it&#x27;s actually good, becuase it&#x27;s probably better to fail fast in a recognizable way. But if you&#x27;re writing a library and offering OTHER people that facility you can&#x27;t support them well (and you will not be well supported by Go libraries).<p><i>Build Tooling</i><p>Go&#x27;s general toolchain is solid and its compiler is wicked fast. But its build story is still really, really bad. Go originally had this mountain of filesystem around every project that was tricky and error prone to share around projects.<p>With recent releases, they&#x27;ve moved to something that resembles Ruby On Rails&#x27;s &quot;vendor&quot; approach, where a sub directory contains a whole checkout of each dependency&#x27;s code. This is actually a pretty major improvement (in part becuase it works better with Github, which is Go&#x27;s primary distribution mechanism). But even with this change, managing a codebase over time is error prone. Unlike Maven and Nuget, there is no enforced concept of version releases (nor discipline around snapshotting) in Github. So if the maintainer of the library has poor discipline (or if there is code poorly tagged during a maintainer change), it can be difficult to get the exact version of a library you want with the exact bugfixes you need.<p>Google&#x27;s response to this is, &quot;We don&#x27;t have this problem because everyone at Google always keeps &#x2F;master clean and we basically never make breaking API changes.&quot; But if you talk to them internally, the reality is more what you&#x27;d expect. Sometimes a lot of time is lost fixing that.<p><i>Everything else I wanted to say (aka &quot;Conclusions&quot;)</i><p>On balance, Go is a good environment for making executables. But a lot of why people like it stems from negative experiences they&#x27;ve had with scripting languages and their poor packaging story, Java and its problems keeping up with other managed language runtimes (and oh god its package process is just silly and antiquated).<p>You&#x27;ve already got cutting edge concurrency, static builds, a lightweight crossplatform runtime with CoreCLR, and pretty fast cross-compilation. For you, what you might find refreshing is how very clean and unified the Go langauge is. It is many things, but one thing it excels at appealing to is the pythonic there-is-one-way-get-in-line crowd. It is small, purpose-built, and singularly uncomplicated. C# has a &quot;history&quot; and &quot;legacy feature support.&quot; Things like delegates that have fallen out of fashion now but are still lurking in the codebase or backing other more modern features.<p>If you want to try the concurrency model but don&#x27;t know if you wanna commit to a whole new runtime, do try F# if you haven&#x27;t yet.

2016-03-02 00:16:49,"&gt; What is truly scary is that the banks and financial institutions have not implemented OAuth. Currently, financial data is provided to third party apps via aggregators, like Plaid and Yodlee.<p>Hi. I was the CTO of Level Money, that ultimately had a meta-aggregation platform on top of all the major aggregators. We were acquired by Capital One. Disclosures: complete.<p>Can I just put out there: every major FI has talked about OAuth2. We all know about OAuth2. It&#x27;s entirely within our technical capabilities to make an API and then allow OAuth2 access. We could even make said access public. The &quot;can they&quot; is answered: yes we could. Yes, we have prototypes.<p>And yes, there are non-technical obstacles. Pardon me while I Nod Dance &amp; Amble.<p>But there is a larger question about the aggregation problem. Banks are rightly concerned that if they do open these up, they&#x27;ll be consumed wholesale by the major tech companies. You could imagine a world where Google partners with your bank to make a pretty amazing experience, but in the process it&#x27;s almost certain that Google would have a significant upper hand. Most banks (even C1360, which I and many other people are working constantly on modernizing) simply aren&#x27;t ready to work with giants like Microsoft, Google or Facebook as equals. That, sadly, will take years as these organizations realize they have to do this.<p>We&#x27;re all in sort of a slow motion race towards this goal. Slow motion compared to the outside world (as I am all to keenly aware), that is. Internally, the process by which we do this is hugely complicated by US law and regulation. There is this wonderful thing where &quot;regulatory capture&quot; backfires and then you&#x27;re imprisoned. For every thing that a bank charter enables, it closes off another 2-3 things that never mattered until things started being judged by their slickness in a mobile app context.<p>As for disconnecting from aggregators, let me tell you as an insider what you can do. Change your password. No really, change your bank password. EVERY major aggregator has a flow that requires they respect this at a technical level. If that fails, it&#x27;s on your bank and you should shout at them VERY loudly.<p>But before you do, make sure you are ready to prove yourself as a banker. What will happen with most aggregators is that they&#x27;ll have to decide, &quot;is this person actually gone or is this stupid web scraper just having a bit of a problem?&quot; They&#x27;ll try and log in again, at least once in most cases. If you have hooked up multiple services (or the same service multiple times), these will trigger account lockouts just like any failed web login would.",Facebook,gt truli scari bank financi institut implement oauth current financi data provid third parti app aggreg like plaid yodle <p> hi cto level money ultim meta-aggreg platform top major aggreg acquir capit one disclosur complet <p> put everi major fi talk oauth 2 know oauth 2 #x27 entir within technic capabl make api allow oauth 2 access could even make said access public quot quot answer ye could ye prototyp <p> ye non-techn obstacl pardon nod danc amp ambl <p> larger question aggreg problem bank rightli concern open #x27 consum wholesal major tech compani could imagin world googl partner bank make pretti amaz experi process #x27 almost certain googl would signific upper hand bank even c1360 mani peopl work constantli modern simpli #x27 readi work giant like microsoft googl facebook equal sadli take year organ realiz <p> #x27 sort slow motion race toward goal slow motion compar outsid world keenli awar intern process huge complic us law regul wonder thing quot regulatori captur quot backfir #x27 imprison everi thing bank charter enabl close anoth 2 3 thing never matter thing start judg slick mobil app context <p> disconnect aggreg let tell insid chang password realli chang bank password everi major aggreg flow requir respect technic level fail #x27 bank shout loudli <p> make sure readi prove banker happen aggreg #x27 decid quot person actual gone stupid web scraper bit problem quot #x27 tri log least case hook multipl servic servic multipl time trigger account lockout like fail web login would,-0.03542857142857142,0.44607936507936513

I’m curious if this is your feedback on the pace of changes, or if this is just a guess.<p>In reality React API surface area is pretty small so most changes are automated by codemods. Codemods are programs that modify your source code. They work pretty well because Facebook uses them on a large scale.<p>Not everything is covered by codemods but generally the feeling I get from talking to the community is that React moves at an acceptable rate, and changes take about a day to apply once a three months for most apps. Deprecation warnings also give you several months to fix use cases that will be unsupported in the next version.<p>In return, this allows React to become a better library and not stagnate.

I talk to a lot of people in the React ecosystem, and so far the feedback I heard is that updating React has been the least of their worries, compared to some other libraries in the ecosystem which are far less stable.<p>Personally, I updated a fairly large (~1000 modules) app from React 0.11, to 0.12, to 0.13.

2016-02-10 22:16:22,"I know there are theoretical alternatives to Twitter, but until the appropriate userbase is out there then they&#x27;re not truly viable alternatives. I know that&#x27;s a Catch-22, or a paradox, or whatever you want to call it, but that&#x27;s the sad reality for those of us that would like to leave the platform. So, in lieu of leaving, here are the features I feel like would help Twitter retain me as a user:<p>1. Bring back custom apps! Twitter is a <i>service</i>, and I want control over how I access that service. This would also take such a huge burden off of Twitter: don&#x27;t care about the super bowl? Use an app that lets you filter hashtags, piece of cake! So many features can be implemented on top of a service, with no extra effort from Twitter. I get that this could  conceivably enable filtering timeline ads, but seriously they can just pull API keys for apps that do that, it&#x27;s a non-issue.<p>2. Let me subscribe to ideas, not just people. If I <i>do</i> care about the super bowl, maybe let me turn on push notifications for tweets about it from people within my network for whom I otherwise do not have push notifications enabled.<p>3. Make chronological timelines a setting. Not an option, not a tab, a semi-permanently enabled <i>setting</i>. It&#x27;s the most annoying thing about Facebook right now, having to explicitly re-enable chronological timelines every week or so when Facebook has &quot;forgotten&quot;. As it stands, even that much is an improvement over Twitter&#x27;s proposed always-on non-chronological timeline.<p>4. Don&#x27;t nanny me unless I ask you to. There have been reports that Twitter has blocked notifications for @replied tweets because Twitter suspected the tweet would be offensive. I get that harassment is an issue and that Twitter was trying to be proactive, but make it an option. The user in this case was failing to be notified of tweets they <i>wanted</i> to see, and had no way to disable the &quot;feature&quot;.<p>5. Inconsistency foments distrust. If you want that blue check mark to mean something then you&#x27;d best lay out a solid and strict process for them. I&#x27;ve seen at least one person have theirs removed over unsubstantiated claims, yet more egregious offenders have kept theirs throughout. I&#x27;ve seen others go through the process for acquire their blue checks and they always seem to have different requirements.

It&#x27;s a pain in the butt sometimes, especially when making schema changes, but ensuring everything works properly even when you have multiple versions running in production can really help with confidence in making changes.<p>You do have to think several steps ahead when making big changes; the (internal-only) project I work on is in the process of completely changing our DB schema and we&#x27;re redoing our API completely as well.  We&#x27;re attempting to keep our old API running in parallel while migrating literally everything underneath it, which is a fun challenge.

2016-02-03 21:32:42,"Writing release notes for consumer software doesn&#x27;t make sense. They are a throwback to boxed software and should be abolished:<p>1. With A&#x2F;B testing and server-side feature flags they don&#x27;t reflect what the user will see.<p>2. With technology like React Native and PhoneGap changes are decoupled from shipping an updated ipa&#x2F;apk.<p>3. With most apps shipping quickly (some every 2 weeks) localization of release notes becomes a long pole.<p>4. Simple text is not effective for showing users potential benefits or training how to use something.<p>5. They can be misleading...saying something like &quot;fixed a startup crash&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean for a particular user the startup crash they are experiencing is fixed.<p>6.

2016-01-27 10:32:51,"For most problems, the following is how you define a component:<p><pre><code>    function Comp(state) {
        return React.createElement(
          &#x27;div&#x27;, &#x2F;&#x2F; tag name
          {}, &#x2F;&#x2F; props&#x2F;attributes
          &#x27;Hello &#x27;, state.name &#x2F;&#x2F; children

      React.createElement(Comp, {name: &#x27;World&#x27;}),
      document.getElementById(&#x27;stage&#x27;)
    );

So in those situations the entire surface of the React API consists of two functions: React.createElement and ReactDOM.render. And if you use JSX, you won&#x27;t even directly use React.createElement in your code.<p>React is conceptually trivial. The API has been getting tighter with each release. React is in active development but so are all of its competitors[1][2]. React is production ready -- Facebook is even dogfooding the pre-releases in production.<p>[1]: in fact, when a library&#x2F;frameworks stops being actively developed people start assuming it&#x27;s dead. Counter-example: Redux is no longer actively being developed because it is officially complete and the implementation is so straightforward and resilient it can&#x27;t really be improved right now.<p>[2]: the reason it&#x27;s bogus to compare it to Angular2 &quot;because that&#x27;s not finished yet either&quot; is that Angular2 is being built to spec whereas React is being developed under use. Angular2 will be &quot;finished&quot; when the full spec is implemented.

2016-01-25 22:20:58,"I&#x27;m a huge proponent of the Zero UI movement. I gave a talk last year at a local Google DevFest about a CMS I created for a Priest friend&#x27;s Church that didn&#x27;t have any user interface to speak of. It relied on Google Drive to host all the files that the staff and teachers at his Parish needed to edit, and all they needed to do was leverage their existing knowledge of the OS&#x27;s file system and Microsoft Word to do it. A script runs every half-hour to update the static site based on the changes to and additions of files in their shared Google Drive account.<p>All of the pictures come directly from their Facebook account via the Facebook API and the weekly PDF newsletter is sent using Mailchimp and pulled from their Google Drive as well. They went from almost no engagement from the staff to close to 100% engagement after we implemented the system.<p>Before that the site was built on Drupal and needlessly complex. Nobody used it. It&#x27;s so easy to forget how daunting learning another user interface can be for the average person. We may think we&#x27;re being clever when we create our beautiful snowflake UI&#x27;s but all we&#x27;re doing is adding more work to somebody&#x27;s already full plate (and K-12 teachers&#x27; plates are overflowing). There&#x27;s a lot of cognitive overhead that comes with things like remembering username&#x2F;password combinations, how to upload files to a website (or understanding what that even <i>means</i>), navigating around a website, editing text in something other than Microsoft Word, and other skills and knowledge we take for granted.<p>With the Google-Drive-As-A-CMS implementation, none of the teachers had to learn anything new. They simply needed to leverage skills they were already expected to have (filesystems, Word, Excel, Powerpoint).<p>I&#x27;d love for more of us software developers and designers to take a step back and ask ourselves the question &quot;am I making my user&#x27;s life easier, or am I adding complexity to it?&quot;.

Almost all systems have a user id, but the distinction here is slightly different.  Instead of a user record which has an id, username and possibly full name, Facebook likely has a user record with an id, a (display) username, and then there is a separate set of auth records with the multiple ways you can authenticate to the account, such as emails and passwords, API tokens, phone numbers, etc.<p>It may not sound like a big distinction, but there <i>is</i> a big distinction there.

2015-11-25 01:02:38,"I used to describe myself as a web standards evangelist ten years ago and my first instinct when I saw React (both because of JSX and because it was from Facebook) was to laugh and shake my head (until I decided to &quot;give it five minutes&quot; and found out I was wrong) so I hope my perspective could make some sense to you.<p>--<p>Just to clarify: React is not about killing the separation of concerns. React is about one thing: converting application state to a component tree and rendering that component tree to the DOM via highly optimised diffing.<p>At the base level, React turns state into component trees. Similarly, Redux is only about managing state and changes to that state. These are fairly straightforward ideas but having them as clearly defined building blocks with an extremely straightforward API (Redux moreso than React but in the trivial case a React component as of 0.14 can be a plain old pure function) radically simplifies application development.<p>I&#x27;ll say it again: application development. I haven&#x27;t said anything about HTML and CSS yet. This is as relevant to the web as it is to native application development and it&#x27;s not an accident that React has been decoupled from ReactDOM with the latter now being merely the implementation detail of going the last mile and rendering things to the DOM (or to HTML strings) and maintaining DOM bindings and diffs.<p>--<p>A quick interlude: JSX is not HTML. It looks like XML and in many examples it has HTML tag names in it, but it&#x27;s not HTML -- nor is it XML for that matter. It&#x27;s just (entirely optional but very useful once you get over the initial visceral discomfort) syntactic sugar for defining component trees (not DOM subtrees). The syntax is obviously based on XML but it is a lot simpler and the familiarity obviously helps.<p>--<p>One thing most people don&#x27;t understand about React (not least because React isn&#x27;t vocal enough about it -- just like Flux wasn&#x27;t vocal enough about certain concepts until Redux came along and showcased why they&#x27;re important and useful) is that you can and should distinguish between presentational components and application logic.<p>If you use Redux (or Flux -- but with Flux there&#x27;s the problem that most things called Flux aren&#x27;t actually Flux because nobody really understood it) most of your components will be entirely presentational and the logic will live outside the components except for a few so-called &quot;containers&quot; which are just extremely thin wrappers.<p>So with React+Redux you then have your component structure living in React components and your logic living in a few functions that describe transitions of the immutable application state plus a few &quot;containers&quot; that just describe how the state is applied to the API of the few &quot;smart&quot; components that actually need interaction.<p>Sure, HTML strings intuitively <i>feel</i> more appropriate for describing these components and Web Components definitely look more &quot;HTML-like&quot; in that regard, but at the end of the day you&#x27;re still writing something XML-like with made up elements (whether they&#x27;re Web Components or React &quot;components&quot;) that needs to be processed by JavaScript before being turned into the actual DOM.<p>--<p>One major change React brings to the table that isn&#x27;t spoken nearly as much of as it should be is that React can be used to render applications to HTML, without the DOM, on the server. This usually gets mentioned in the context of &quot;load times&quot; or &quot;SEO friendliness&quot; but it&#x27;s a pretty significant property of React.<p>Not only can React on the client &quot;seamlessly&quot; re-use the server-rendered DOM and attach itself like a jQuery plugin would but being able to render the application (and using Redux: render it with an arbitrary state) means you can truly embrace the idea of progressive enhancement without giving up the comfort of web application tooling.<p>Some years ago there was a lot of hype (well, not as much by a long stretch but some hype nevertheless) around the idea of making web apps work without JS (YUI[0] allowing server-side rendering of JS web apps and PJAX[1] enabling web sites to behave more like apps). Instead of mucking around with client-side templates you would render pages on the server and then intercept internal links to fetch and inject only the bits that changed between the current page and the next.<p>React+Redux is basically PJAX, but it&#x27;s also the polar oppsite. Instead of rendering everything using server-side technologies, you render everything using client-side technologies. And instead of offloading re-renders to the server you keep them in the client when possible (where they can be further optimised thanks to DOM diffing).<p>Let me restate that: React+Redux allows you to build &quot;Rich Internet Applications&quot; in a way that makes it possible to support JavaScript-free fallbacks out of the box. There&#x27;s nothing stopping developers from making the HTML output of their React apps richly semantic and accessible either (even though that represents the Eternal War of the web).<p>The idea is not new[2] but with React it&#x27;s not only achievable but <i>easily</i> achievable. And unlike Web Components it only needs existing technologies that are widely supported (it even works in IE8).<p>--<p>The PandaStrike article you linked is not a rebuttal of React. It&#x27;s a rebuttal of traditional client-side web applications. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether they are built with Angular or Backbone or React -- the arguments are mostly universal. The difference is that React is the only option today that (despite not having HTML &quot;templates&quot;) allows developers to do something smarter.<p>Of course React is a land grab. <i>Every</i> open source project is. But it&#x27;s not an attack on the Open Web anymore than jQuery was an attack on the Open Web before querySelectorAll or XMLHttpRequest landed in a spec. That you&#x27;re no longer writing straight-up HTML in a text file doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re no better off than if you were using GWT[3].<p>And who says Web Components are the Right Choice just because they&#x27;re becoming part of the native platform? Sometimes the thing we think we want[4] isn&#x27;t what we really need[5], even if it&#x27;s on track to become a standard.<p>--<p>[0] <a

2015-11-01 20:52:32,"Thanks for explaining.  This is a pain point I think everyone that does service oriented architecture has to some level.<p>Most shops I have worked in seem to mostly attack this via procedure.  Ie - release is OK&#x27;d by QA, then deploy ticket is made that specifies what versions go where, and then operations is responsible for executing this procedure and ensuring its sanity.<p>If you have a lot of hands in the pot, (too many cooks), then this is bound to have issues when everyone is busy and things get overlooked.<p>There is a lot of automation that can help however.  Dependency management in this sense I think has to be more elaborate than just &quot;is X installed or deployed&quot;, but you might also want to ask &quot;is X healthy?&quot;  Just because a package has been installed doesn&#x27;t mean its working.<p>So that is in my opinion why there is no one-size-fits-all solution for this.  Many releases are fully compatible with each other, and in simple applications probably even more so, but once you have many teams working on many services, it can be a nightmare.<p>A lot of places have granular feature management.  So, frontend can fail gracefully if feature is not supported on backend.  Often backend supports more than 1 fronted version set.  You can use versioned api&#x27;s (like putting a version in an http header, or namespacing features like &#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;x, &#x2F;api&#x2F;v2&#x2F;x).  (it&#x27;s been said a huge distributed app like facebook has something like 500 different versions of components all running concurrently)<p>You can have your deployment automation do things like check to see if backend has required version (which would be something that you would have to put in hiera&#x2F;equiv of what versions are required), and even more importantly if they are responding to health checks.<p>One project I currently work on has a very distributed architecture, and every application has to conform to a health check endpoint that returns its state and its version.  So we have scripts that do either rolling deploys or green&#x2F;blue deploys depending on what we are deploying, and we can define the order in which services are deployed.  We can deploy them concurrently&#x2F;rolling, or independent&#x2F;rolling, or either of those flavors non-rolling, or green&#x2F;blue.<p>So if we say we are deploying fronted3.1, backend4.2, and we are replacing frontend3.0 and backend 4.1, this would be seen by the deploy scripts (and operations team) as a single changeset for the environment.  So if frontend3.1 needed backend4.1 to function, we would specify a independent rolling deployment, so for each service thats being deployed (starting with the backend), we would roll out server by server at a specified interval, and we would wait for that server to return a healthy health check with the specified version.  If this fails the deploy is rolled back and notifications are sent.<p>^ with this working correctly, we have to have the understanding with the application developers that we will never release a backend that is not backwards compatible with any components that rely on this. (beyond a cutoff version, which those do exist too)<p>In practice this works quite well, but is not magic, and definitely requires some up front development of automation.<p>So, sorry for the long post, I think this is a long winded way of saying, my opinion is that this belongs in a configuration management, as the logic encapsulating &quot;what version goes where&quot; gets more complex over time, and so some code, logic, decision making, and failsafes all have to be carefully thought out.",Facebook,thank explain pain point think everyon servic orient architectur level <p> shop work seem mostli attack procedur ie releas ok #x27 ;d qa deploy ticket made specifi version go oper respons execut procedur ensur saniti <p> lot hand pot mani cook bound issu everyon busi thing get overlook <p> lot autom help howev depend manag sens think elabor quot x instal deploy quot might also want ask quot x healthi quot packag instal #x27 mean work <p> opinion one-size-fits-al solut mani releas fulli compat simpl applic probabl even mani team work mani servic nightmar <p> lot place granular featur manag frontend fail grace featur support backend often backend support 1 front version set use version api #x27 like put version http header namespac featur like #x2f api #x2f v1 #x2f x #x2f api #x2f v2 #x2f x #x27 said huge distribut app like facebook someth like 500 differ version compon run concurr <p> deploy autom thing like check see backend requir version would someth would put hiera #x2f equiv version requir even importantli respond health check <p> one project current work distribut architectur everi applic conform health check endpoint return state version script either roll deploy green #x2f blue deploy depend deploy defin order servic deploy deploy concurr #x2f roll independ #x2f roll either flavor non-rol green #x2f blue <p> say deploy front 3.1 backend 4.2 replac frontend 3.0 backend 4.1 would seen deploy script oper team singl changeset environ frontend 3.1 need backend 4.1 function would specifi independ roll deploy servic that deploy start backend would roll server server specifi interv would wait server return healthi health check specifi version fail deploy roll back notif sent <p> work correctli understand applic develop never releas backend backward compat compon reli beyond cutoff version exist <p> practic work quit well magic definit requir front develop autom <p> sorri long post think long wind way say opinion belong configur manag logic encapsul quot version goe quot get complex time code logic decis make failsaf care thought,-0.047499999999999994,0.4058333333333334

2015-10-08 11:31:58,"Hi HN<p>a lot has changed since our last Show HN, and i guess it was time to share these change with you.<p>for those who weren&#x27;t here the first time, we try to catch domain squatting using a bunch of techniques we already used when doing it manually, but in a purely automated fashion. your root domain (think &#x27;facebook&#x27;, &#x27;twitter&#x27;, &#x27;ycombinator&#x27;, etc...) gets through blenders that generate variants, that we&#x27;ll gather info on.<p>we now have all the basics in place so i can confidently call it production ready. free accounts are still the same deal, one domain, five TLDs, all present and future generators, whois and dns resolver, plus a few more still in the oven, and one run per week, which should be enough if your needs are not massive and&#x2F;or specific.
you also now have paying options for people with more intensive needs, either timing wise (down to one run per day, and one run per 4 hours will be a possibility once i&#x27;m confident 1: we can handle it, 2: it can actually provide value in the real world) or number-of-tlds-wise.<p>notifications! yeap i know it&#x27;s basic, but we now send you a mail when a run is complete, so you don&#x27;t have to bother reloading waiting for that progress bar to reach 100%. a few client asked us about sms notification, but i&#x27;m not sure about multiple notification channels yet.<p>so what&#x27;s next :<p>we have a bunch of stuff that stayed on the backburner while i was working on making the production as autonomous as possible (complete CI&#x2F;CD stack, built with chef, openstack heat, jenkins, the whole shebang) and the other dev was working on ironing the kinks
existing when interacting with horrible protocols like whois (for the sake of everyone&#x27;s sanity, i really hope rdap (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.rdap.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.rdap.org&#x2F;</a>) gets traction) or misbehaving dns, or just plain old bugs. we&#x27;re now bringing them back on the front of the workbench.<p>parking detection.<p>this one is simple, and everybody will get it, but i noticed a large number of parked domains in resolution runs, so they&#x27;ll be marked as such.<p>automated phishing detection.<p>this has been a major demand so i&#x27;m prototyping a CV system (ab)using ghost.py and opencv to see if i can get something that has a reasonable false positive rate.<p>malware detection.<p>a smaller demand because it&#x27;s already well covered by other products. for the moment paying accounts get access to google safebrowsing, and i have a bunch of threat exchange APIs access ready to enter the quorum. there&#x27;s a lot of datasharing between those, so i don&#x27;t want to generate false positives because of data sharing. i have also been working slowly on PR for cuckoo sandbox that&#x27;ll help me launch fleets of sandboxes in various configuration (hopefully i&#x27;ll have enough variants that the client is able to more or less choose the one that correspond to its production environment to try and catch targeted attacks)<p>keyword prediction based on the root domain.<p>we have a keyword generator that can generate domain variants, think &#x27;cheap-brand&#x27; for &#x27;brand&#x27;, but if you&#x27;re like me you probably can&#x27;t think of a lot of those (i had good success asking marketing guys for ideas). once again AI to the rescue, i&#x27;m tracking which keywords had the most &#x27;success&#x27; in finding resolving variants, which means once i&#x27;m able to establish lexical domains i&#x27;ll be able to offer everyone a &#x27;most likely keyword for this domain&#x27; help to feed the generator.<p>an API!<p>at the very beginning, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and the iphone 5s the cool product of the year, squatmon was just a very large and very ugly python script i used in various recon engagements. as we decided to slap a shiny web interface on it and share it with others, we didn&#x27;t take the time to make an API the first class citizen and the web interface just the reference client implementation.

2015-09-30 11:31:56,"Sangria is a scala GraphQL server. Facebook released an initial reference implementation in javascript, but I wanted the type-safety that scala gives. If you&#x27;re more comfortable with JS you could check that out. See <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;relay&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;relay&#x2F;</a>.<p>With GraphQL you don&#x27;t write views per se, but you make data available. The client can pick and choose which of the exposed attributes it needs to render a view. So if you have, say, a user profile page, you might use relay to declare that you need something like:<p><pre><code>    user(id: $userId) {
      username
      age
    }
</code></pre>
Then relay will hit your graphql server and add this data to your react props.<p>It&#x27;s a similar thing with mutations - you expose operations through your server and then relay handles calling it with the necessary data, and propagating back the response into the UI.<p>I&#x27;ve found this approach to be very powerful and quick to develop in (once I got my head around it). With REST, you have to keep on adding new endpoints or fiddling with your server if you need more attributes from it. E.g. say you also want the user&#x27;s gender. With traditional REST you&#x27;d need to make this change in your client (to request that extra data) and update your server to expose it. Or perhaps you&#x27;d add a new endpoint that returned more data about a user. Then you may also need to decide what happens with legacy clients. Should they fail if they receive extra, unexpected data, or do you version your API, etc.?<p>With GraphQL you can choose to expose all of the different attributes on your user model (with authentication&#x2F;authorisation, etc as appropriate) in-advance, and then if clients need the gender, they can just request it via relay.<p>After I tried writing an app using REST and continually feeling like I was walking in mud, this is a real breath of fresh air, and I feel productive again.

2015-09-14 22:43:30,"I was pleasantly surprised that the latest Chrome for Android delivers push notifications for Facebook due to a new W3C API, and Facebook&#x27;s mobile web interface has been in good shape for some time, so right now Facebook&#x27;s native app is completely optional.

But I do think they could do a better job, I mean I&#x27;m all for Firefox OS and what that means for Mozilla, but I feel their Android effort is subpar and that&#x27;s a shame, given that Android is the modern Windows and there&#x27;s plenty of room for Firefox on it. I mean right now Firefox is the only app I have that wasn&#x27;t updated for the material design guidelines and they didn&#x27;t even try to fake it.

It is based on React [1] and SwarmJS [2] and primarily intended for embedding into applications to support rich text entry with real-time collaboration. Technically, it works similarly to Google Docs and eschews ContentEditable in favor of a custom javascript-based editor surface and layout engine [3]. As far as I know, this is the first open source implementation of this technique. Please see the project README and source code [4] for more details. Note that this is pretty new and hasn&#x27;t seen any real-world testing&#x2F;usage, so there are some known bugs [5] and likely lots of unknown ones as well.<p>Depending on interest, I am considering offering the editor as a software-as-a-service solution. Because it is intended for real-time collaboration, a server-side component is (currently) required. While a simple implementation is part of the open source project, a more complete commercial service could handle storage, communications, security, availability, and provide a simple but powerful API for developers. The API would allow interaction with client-side editors and the data they contain, including real-time server-side push updates as editor contents change.

We need a way to &quot;program.&quot; But switching the goal from building applications to analyzing and communicating information changes everything. Our current programming tools are awful thinking tools. Instead, they were designed to build complex systems. How much effort does it take to write a program to scan through your facebook friends and check to see if someone who usually isn&#x27;t in your area currently is?...People aren&#x27;t really tring to build the next Facebook, they&#x27;re trying to use the information from it in a different way.</i><p>The example given here by the OP strikes me as a good example of how and why programming is complicated, and what people generally <i>want</i> their programs to do is unlikely to be doable without knowing how to program.<p>Case in point: why can&#x27;t a layperson just make a little app &quot;to scan through your facebook friends and check to see if someone who usually isn&#x27;t in your area currently is&quot;? The ease, glib answer is: well, Facebook&#x27;s developer API requires several hoops to jump through, including OAuth of clients and so forth. So that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no drag-and-drop-plug-and-play module system for such a feature.<p>The bigger answer is the answer to the question of why does Facebook&#x27;s API have to be so complicated? Well, besides business reasons...FB&#x27;s API is a public-facing abstraction over a system in which a billion people have agreed to (semi-)authenticate themselves and communicate a variety of real-time things about themselves. As annoying as it is to program your own little FB apps...it&#x27;s complicated because the system it interfaces with is overwhelmingly and amazingly complicated.<p>I don&#x27;t see much room for improvement in making programming easier in this regard.

Facebook offers $3bn in cash. To an extent FAR greater than when Zuck made the offer to Instagram, people were aligned in saying Evan S should take the offer. Snapchat, after all, in many people&#x27;s minds was about sexting and distasteful things - take the money. Growth would top out eventually, people would get over it. Evan, however, disagreed - Snapchat wasn&#x27;t mostly used for sexting, it was used for sharing moments. And it was working, and in fact it had become inevitable to him.

2015-07-28 22:18:19,"While I&#x27;m sure it helps to be a math major anywhere, anyone who has been trained to be a careful analytic thinker would be a good candidate to become a programmer. For instance if you were a humanities major from a school with a strong academic reputation and you actually took your coursework seriously as an undergrad.<p>As much as programming is applied math, most companies are not Google or Facebook and have problems that can suffer the inefficiency of a non-expert. A lot of programming jobs ask you to get data from a form or API, do something with it and show some HTML. And that HTML needs to be styled in CSS and have some neat UI elements that are fine tuned in Javascript. There is nothing about that kind of work that favors a math major over English major.<p>The situation changes if your company is huge, handling thousands of requests a second so small inefficiencies add up and are wasteful on a large scale or even cause the software to break entirely. But assuming you have a smart CTO&#x2F;Lead you should know where potential pain points in your code are and still be able to hire a relatively inexperienced junior and get good work out of that person. I have a friend who was an Ivy CS grad, worked at Google then worked at Squarespace.

2015-07-21 18:58:29,"The first half of the article was good and balanced. I especially like the distinction in lay terms: copyleft to push freedom; non-copyleft to push adoption. That&#x27;s a great way to describe it to a person contemplating what license to choose. Then, the article goes in a different direction that embodies negative qualities that author critiqued in the related presentation. Let&#x27;s address a bit of this from my pro-consumer, pro-security&#x2F;quality, pro-OSS, anti-copyleft perspective. Mentioned that just so my bias is clear upfront and why I push adoption-oriented licenses (esp for open hardware &amp; high assurance).<p>re stepping stone. Yes, this is the common goal of proprietary use of anti-copyleft software. IIRC, copyleft software got its start using the architecture, languages, tools, and platforms of BSD and proprietary offerings. So, even GPL proponents build on existing work. Anyone wanting an open, free version of a given enhancement can similarly produce it starting with the same stepping stones.<p>re open to closed. We saw this happen with Apple App Store, the QNX source reversal, attempts to combine open code with DRM, and so on. This is bad. However, it almost exclusively happens with companies whose licensing, TOS&#x27;s, SLA&#x27;s, etc allow for this sort of thing. That&#x27;s where the problem is. Avoiding such companies, selecting safest licenses, and&#x2F;or ensuring certain conditions are perpetual in contracts&#x2F;licenses are easiest solution. GPL is actually a successful implementation of my claim, although it wasn&#x27;t good enough. Affero corrected a major deficiency and more evolutions will probably follow. Many more licensing schemes can happen to reduce negative impact of business participation while empowering users.<p>The common theme in most gripes is what the companies do. The reason we have this problem is that users almost exclusively do business with scumbag companies. They don&#x27;t care about terms. They don&#x27;t care about its ethics. Prior abuses rarely make them change companies (see Microsoft and Facebook). They don&#x27;t try to leverage their buying power to force (existing) or incentivize (startups) companies to negotiate something that&#x27;s favorable to them and future-proof in main risk areas. Like the old saying, the only thing that was necessary for triumph of evil was that good people did nothing [while evil kept its eye on the ball and its hands&#x2F;feet in a sprint].<p>A lot of these problems can be avoided by simply investing in the right organizations. People who pick up Microsoft&#x27;s server operating system are in for more schemes than those that used FreeBSD with commercial support. Certain small companies behind IDE&#x27;s and libraries have had <i>great</i> terms for their users for years with minimal hassles unlike the mess that&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s development tools. Services provided by non-profits, cooperatives, and companies simply focused on customer satisfaction have done great compared to race to bottom in cost or highest shareholder earnings that get many others scheming on customers. Pick the right people&#x2F;companies&#x2F;tools, maintain an out to avoid lock-in (open formats&#x2F;API&#x27;s help), and invest in that. Double down on it if they use permissive licenses and re-invest back into their communities.<p>In the end, this is more a problem of incentives than purely a legal one. People trust companies that don&#x27;t care about them. They get screwed. Stop doing that. Do plenty more of the opposite. On top of it, explore alternatives [1] to popular source-sharing models in case business opportunities arise. Get momentum going in directions other than companies that do lock-in and lock-down. After all, I&#x27;ve done a lot of business with proprietary companies and have mostly avoided being boxed in. Same goes for FOSS use. Imagine that... All about what you use, how, and from whom. Sacrifices will need to be made, though, and now we&#x27;re getting back to user demand (incentives) driving the negative practices.<p>Outside a niche, I don&#x27;t see it happening because market as a whole won&#x27;t take responsibility to make it happen. The problems are market&#x27;s fault, as usual. Good that niche commercial, OSS, and FOSS have given us plenty of good stuff to work with. I encourage all of them to keep at it without a need to fight with any. I avoid GPL strictly for economic reasons: certain investments don&#x27;t happen, esp high assurance or ASIC development, unless they can recover the cost somehow. Additionally, companies adopting high quality components makes stuff more robust over time. Finally, making money allows them to fight inevitable patent suits that will attempt to put them out of business and create more patents for defensive use. So, for economic reasons, I oppose the GPL in some spaces while respecting it and being neutral in others. My OS is GPL, for instance, and I&#x27;m grateful to its developers &amp; community. :)<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;friday_squid_bl_424.html#c6051639"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;friday_squid_...</a>",Facebook,"first half articl good balanc especi like distinct lay term copyleft push freedom non-copyleft push adopt #x27 great way describ person contempl licens choos articl goe differ direct embodi neg qualiti author critiqu relat present let #x27 address bit pro-consum pro-secur #x2f qualiti pro-oss anti-copyleft perspect mention bia clear upfront push adoption-ori licens esp open hardwar amp high assur <p> step stone ye common goal proprietari use anti-copyleft softwar iirc copyleft softwar got start use architectur languag tool platform bsd proprietari offer even gpl propon build exist work anyon want open free version given enhanc similarli produc start step stone <p> open close saw happen appl app store qnx sourc revers attempt combin open code drm bad howev almost exclus happen compani whose licens to #x27 sla #x27 etc allow sort thing #x27 problem avoid compani select safest licens #x2f ;o r ensur certain condit perpetu contract #x2f licens easiest solut gpl actual success implement claim although #x27 good enough affero correct major defici evolut probabl follow mani licens scheme happen reduc neg impact busi particip empow user <p> common theme gripe compani reason problem user almost exclus busi scumbag compani #x27 care term #x27 care ethic prior abus rare make chang compani see microsoft facebook #x27 tri leverag buy power forc exist incentiv startup compani negoti someth #x27 favor future-proof main risk area like old say thing necessari triumph evil good peopl noth evil kept eye ball hand #x2f feet sprint <p> lot problem avoid simpli invest right organ peopl pick microsoft #x27 server oper system scheme use freebsd commerci support certain small compani behind ide #x27 librari <i> great </i> term user year minim hassl unlik mess #x27 microsoft #x27 develop tool servic provid non-profit cooper compani simpli focus custom satisfact done great compar race bottom cost highest sharehold earn get mani other scheme custom pick right peopl #x2f compani #x2f tool maintain avoid lock-in open format #x2f api #x27 help invest doubl use permiss licens re-invest back commun <p> end problem incent pure legal one peopl trust compani #x27 care get screw stop plenti opposit top explor altern 1 popular source-shar model case busi opportun aris get momentum go direct compani lock-in lock-down #x27 done lot busi proprietari compani mostli avoid box goe foss use imagin use sacrific need made though #x27 get back user demand incent drive neg practic <p> outsid nich #x27 see happen market whole #x27 take respons make happen problem market #x27 fault usual good nich commerci oss foss given us plenti good stuff work encourag keep without need fight avoid gpl strictli econom reason certain invest #x27 happen esp high assur asic develop unless recov cost somehow addit compani adopt high qualiti compon make stuff robust time final make money allow fight inevit patent suit attempt put busi creat patent defens use econom reason oppos gpl space respect neutral other os gpl instanc #x27 grate develop amp commun :) <p> 1 <a href=""https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.schneier.com&#x2f;blog&#x2f;archives&#x2f;2014&#x2f;05&#x2f;friday_squid_bl_424.html#c6051639"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f www schneier com #x2f blog #x2f archiv #x2f 2014 #x2f 05 #x2f friday_squid </a>",0.12624686716791983,0.48972013366750206
2015-07-19 17:54:18,"Where do you think the most successful web apps (like Slack recently) are emerging?  From the SV echo chamber.<p>To be a talented full-stack web application developer for a <i>successful</i> consumer facing app, you sort of need to have an obsession with UI&#x2F;UX design trends.  Finished web apps that delight customers have an attention to detail that put them over the edge into the realm of being successful.<p>What you need to learn to become a <i>top</i> web app developer is actually punishingly brutal.  People now expect all web apps to operate with the smoothness of having AJAX everywhere that you see with apps like Youtube, Gmail and Facebook. Web app developers who can actually build web apps to that level of quality are extremely valuable.<p>Web development is not easy if you really specialize in it. By that I mean people who have really accumulated best practices and knowledge over common core problems of the web.  These are the people who within a month can return you an app fully loaded with user accounts, multi-tenancy, notifications, emails, subscriptions, the ability to upload documents, search, credit card payments, google maps, API gateways, chats etc.<p>In addition to having programming chops, a lot of their value actually comes from having spent time collecting good &quot;widgets&quot; of useful software they can use for new projects.

2015-06-06 16:58:31,"I’m really excited this was finally shared. A little backstory. This framework is the manifestation of ideas that Mike developed at Mixtent, a startup that produced three products in 2 years and eventually got acquired by Facebook.<p>The biggest advantage this framework has over other more traditional ones like RoR or Django is being able to model product ideas as a graph in code abstractions. This enables product engineers to rapidly prototype ideas (no need to interact with the DB), and jump into features built by other engineers (the node-edge API is standardized).<p>While the first product Mixtent built used more traditional django-style models, it resulted in features that became hard to manage over time. Each model had its own DB table and making changes was painful. The next two were built using a similar graph framework on top of CodeIgniter, and the benefits to prototyping speed and ease-of-understanding were visibly felt by all engineers (including myself).",Facebook,’ realli excit final share littl backstori framework manifest idea mike develop mixtent startup produc three product 2 year eventu got acquir facebook <p> biggest advantag framework tradit one like ror django abl model product idea graph code abstract enabl product engin rapidli prototyp idea need interact db jump featur built engin node-edg api standard <p> first product mixtent built use tradit django-styl model result featur becam hard manag time model db tabl make chang pain next two built use similar graph framework top codeignit benefit prototyp speed ease-of-understand visibl felt engin includ,0.06547619047619048,0.3964285714285714
2015-06-05 17:39:12,"I see it this way: it&#x27;s a choice between being mostly a craftsmen&#x2F;engineer and being an applied scientist (that can also become a very good craftsmen&#x2F;engineer).<p>If you want to limit yourself to jobs that need only concrete skills, specific knowledge (e.g. knowing an API of some framework inside or out, or even knowing the nits and grits of a specific programming language) then a strong portfolio, and self learning might be enough. Although you will always be looked down upon by CS college grad peers once big O and Algorithms &#x2F; data structures discussions are coming up. Even if you know it better than them! (They just assume that you don&#x27;t as you don&#x27;t have a degree)<p>But the bigger downside if you truly choose to be solely a craftsmen is that you always have to keep up or your are out. Technologies change, and if you don&#x27;t change with them, you are obsolete. Even if you know HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Rails to the level you memorized them and have built an impressive portfolio with 2000 stars in GitHub and 10 HN front page submissions. Ask yourself where is that guy who did this 10 years ago? I was one of those, I had Flash stuff that was the equivalent to the above. Got Macromedia site of the day, people in forums and myspace praised my work, I got my work presented in FlashForward conferences. 
Does it worth anything now? zip, nada. think 10-15 years from now. will a starred github JQuery plugin you wrote get you that job when you are 35? 45? 55?<p>In the other hand, if you want transferable skills that are not framework related, you need to either self learn it, (which is hard to prove) or get a degree. the degree serves the following:<p>10% - the actual knowledge (you can get it anywhere), 40% - the self discipline structure that forces you to &quot;self learn&quot;. think of it as a challenge, you pay tuition, they force you to stay focused and self learn by going to lectures &#x2F; watching them online. 30% - is the easy verification that you know those things, instead of reading your portfolio and looking for usage of data structures &#x2F; algorithms (e.g. anything that is not just &quot;trade skills&quot; or &quot;craftsmanship&quot;, future employers can just see your degree, and assume (if you got a decent GPA and it&#x27;s a decent university) that you got that at least covered. 
the last 20% is as others said - soft skills implied from graduating college. employers know that you can handle life on your own, handle deadlines, handle working with a team, handle pressure, and do something that is not immediate gratification.<p>You can always choose to also be a craftsman after you get your degree, in practice, specific technical skills are very important and valuable for employers.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to limit the jobs you can apply for, you need to prove 2 things -<p>1) that you have your CS basics (Algorithms,  Data Structures etc) otherwise you rule out many interesting jobs (not just at Google &#x2F; Facebook, but also many web startups that need more than just CRUD &#x2F; web &#x2F; mobile)<p>2) that you can actually code and use that knowledge in a specific tech stack.<p>You can prove #2 easily by going the portfolio way. 
You make it harder to prove #1 by going the portfolio way, and make it easier by going the degree way.<p>p.s. you can get a CS top 10 US education for about $10,000<p>Step 1: get an accredited US CS undergrad degree online for $4,000 at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uopeople.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uopeople.edu</a><p>Step 2: apply to Georgia Tech Online Master of Science (degree is the same as on-campus degree, which is ranked #9 in the US for Graduate Computer Science degree) and pay only about $6,600 and you don&#x27;t need a GRE! (as opposed to the on campus one). you just need to get B and above in 2 core courses to be fully admitted (not always easy, but doable)<p>The amount of jobs you can do after that grows largely. And I think it will be a little more interesting than just doing the same old CRUD &#x2F; Mobile &#x2F; UI until you retire, and having to learn every 10 years or so a whole new paradigm.<p>Just think of all the build tools, frameworks that there are out there, you are a Grunt + Node + Angular guru today, tomorrow they will look for a Gulp + TypeScript + React guru, and in 10 years OO GUI building will make a comeback and people will return to writing UI using Swing &#x2F; MFC like structure as you can run it natively in a browser using ASM.js.<p>I&#x27;m doing web since 2000, and the amount of technology changes is overwhelming, what is hype today, might not be even in existence 10-15 years from now.<p>Programming principles, (OO, Functional, Reactive etc) and basic CS stuff (Algorithms, Data Structures) will likely stay here a little longer.

Not to mention, as someone who suffers with motion sickness with traditional games, how will the Oculus work for me? Have they solved this riddle? Will they ever?<p>This is also why I see Sony having great success with its Morpheus headset. The PS4 is cheap as-is ($399) and if you already own one, its a no-brainer to go with their product. I&#x27;d be really surprised if Oculus ever goes mainstream.

2015-04-05 23:32:59,"Overall, I like what Angular v1 does and how easy it is to be productive in it - I have helped save multiple companies&#x27; products (medium-sized codebases) because Angular can be extremely quick to iterate on top of and gives you so many tools for that productivity, while unit testing much of it (although the unit testing situation is not quite perfect).<p>I like using Angular relative to Backbone and Ember, although my experience with Ember was last a year ago, and the framework has progressed a lot since then. I like React over Angular 1 currently, especially since it supports robust server-side rendering solutions. React takes some ideas from Angular such as not being opinionated with the models, but makes writing the core of its components much nicer than Angular 1&#x27;s directives. It also does not take much opinions over the service architecture, which also makes me happy, but the tradeoff is that it leaves a lot of developers in the dark as far as how to organize code with it - that is why Facebook pushed the Flux pattern very strongly.<p>Angular 2 definitely took a lot of React&#x27;s good points and integrated them in better ways into Angular 2, or have plans to integrate them. Ideas such as supporting immutable data, virtual DOM (well, at least something similar to virtual DOM anyhow), and unidirectional data flow make their way into Angular 2. Robust dependency injection (no more using $inject or the hacky array syntax for DI) and better API for creating components come as more evolutionary changes from Angular 1. The declarative templates are also a lot simpler, as expression support is more limited than the broad JavaScript-like syntax supported in Angular 1. Shadow DOM being a first class citizen of the framework makes having to worry about component CSS being clobbered a problem of yesterday.<p>Overall, I am excited as a frontend developer - there are a lot of exciting things happening in the frontend world, and the ecosystem is maturing by leaps and bounds.",Facebook,"overal like angular v1 easi product help save multipl compani #x27 product medium-s codebas angular extrem quick iter top give mani tool product unit test much although unit test situat quit perfect <p> like use angular rel backbon ember although experi ember last year ago framework progress lot sinc like react angular 1 current especi sinc support robust server-sid render solut react take idea angular opinion model make write core compon much nicer angular 1 #x27 direct also take much opinion servic architectur also make happi tradeoff leav lot develop dark far organ code facebook push flux pattern strongli <p> angular 2 definit took lot react #x27 good point integr better way angular 2, plan integr idea support immut data virtual dom well least someth similar virtual dom anyhow unidirect data flow make way angular 2 robust depend inject use inject hacki array syntax di better api creat compon come evolutionari chang angular 1 declar templat also lot simpler express support limit broad javascript-lik syntax support angular 1 shadow dom first class citizen framework make worri compon css clobber problem yesterday <p> overal excit frontend develop lot excit thing happen frontend world ecosystem matur leap bound",0.23310185185185187,0.4395833333333334

2015-02-27 07:06:26,"For context, here&#x27;s a discussion from the Atom forum that we had way back in August about the future of React in Atom:<p><a href=""https://discuss.atom.io/t/whats-the-status-of-react-in-atom/11456"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.atom.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;whats-the-status-of-react-in-atom&#x2F;...</a><p>There are a few issues in play here:<p>(1) Atom wants to support a world in which every Atom package can install whatever version of a dependency it wants, including React. This is very common in Node (incidentally, this causes problems if you want to use singletons or instanceof in Node), but fairly uncommon on the Web (where React is primarily used). That is, it&#x27;s rare that you inadvertently load multiple versions of React in your single-page application. If you did, you would likely get an error when adding one React component as a child of another React component because of the way React vends ids. (Solutions are possible, but none is employed today.)<p>From Atom&#x27;s perspective, that is a problem. The only way they can work around it is by providing &quot;one true version of React&quot; with Atom core that all packages must use, but then Atom is forcing all packages to use a particular version of React. That would violate Atom&#x27;s philosophy of letting each package choose its own dependencies.<p>(2) This is not just an issue for React, but for any UI toolkit whose components are not guaranteed to interoperate across versions. To sidestep this issue, Atom has currently decided to use the DOM API&#x2F;HTML custom elements. I would call this the &quot;least common denominator approach,&quot; which satisfies Atom&#x27;s design goals, but fails to provide a higher-level abstraction for building UI in Atom. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>(3) React does not currently support the shadow DOM or custom attributes, which is the new direction that Atom has chosen. As React has not yet been evicted from Atom core, I recently upstreamed a change (<a href=""https://github.com/atom/react/pull/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;atom&#x2F;react&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1</a>) to add one-off support for Atom&#x27;s primary custom elements, &lt;atom-text-editor mini&gt; and &lt;atom-panel&gt;, in the fork of React bundled with Atom. As I develop Atom packages using babel (formerly 6to5) <a href=""http://blog.atom.io/2015/02/04/built-in-6to5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.atom.io&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;04&#x2F;built-in-6to5.html</a>, which has default support for JSX, building UI in React has been a lot of fun. However, the lack of support for custom attributes makes it difficult to do things like add an appropriate onChange handler to an &lt;atom-text-editor&gt; to update the React component&#x27;s state as shown in <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;docs&#x2F;forms.html</a>.<p>(4) React is still version 0.x.x, which means it has not yet committed to a stable API. This makes choosing a version of React to bundle with Atom an even more uncomfortable decision for the Atom team, assuming they were willing to do so in the first place.<p>None of these items implies that there is something fundamentally broken about React&#x27;s model. It just means that the React team has some work to do in order to support Atom&#x27;s use case. The performance graphs cited in the original post are also significant (and of interest to the React team), but even if the performance problems were fixed tomorrow, that alone would probably not be enough for Atom to pull React back into core right now.",Facebook,"context #x27 discuss atom forum way back august futur react atom <p> <a href=""https://discuss.atom.io/t/whats-the-status-of-react-in-atom/11456"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f ;d iscuss atom io #x2f #x2f whats-the-status-of-react-in-atom #x2f </a> <p> issu play <p> 1 atom want support world everi atom packag instal whatev version depend want includ react common node incident caus problem want use singleton instanceof node fairli uncommon web react primarili use #x27 rare inadvert load multipl version react single-pag applic would like get error ad one react compon child anoth react compon way react vend id solut possibl none employ today <p> atom #x27 perspect problem way work around provid quot ;o ne true version react quot atom core packag must use atom forc packag use particular version react would violat atom #x27 philosophi let packag choos depend <p> 2 issu react ui toolkit whose compon guarante interoper across version sidestep issu atom current decid use dom api #x2f html custom element would call quot least common denomin approach quot satisfi atom #x27 design goal fail provid higher-level abstract build ui atom #x27 tradeoff <p> 3 react current support shadow dom custom attribut new direct atom chosen react yet evict atom core recent upstream chang <a href=""https://github.com/atom/react/pull/1"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f github com #x2f atom #x2f react #x2f ;p ull #x2f 1 </a> add one-off support atom #x27 primari custom element lt atom-text-editor mini gt lt atom-panel gt fork react bundl atom develop atom packag use babel formerli 6 to5 <a href=""http://blog.atom.io/2015/02/04/built-in-6to5.html"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f blog atom io #x2f 2015 #x2f 02 #x2f 04 #x2f built-in 6 to5 html </a> default support jsx build ui react lot fun howev lack support custom attribut make difficult thing like add appropri onchang handler lt atom-text-editor gt updat react compon #x27 state shown <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f facebook github io #x2f react #x2f ;d oc #x2f form html </a> <p> 4 react still version 0 x x mean yet commit stabl api make choos version react bundl atom even uncomfort decis atom team assum will first place <p> none item impli someth fundament broken react #x27 model mean react team work order support atom #x27 use case perform graph cite origin post also signific interest react team even perform problem fix tomorrow alon would probabl enough atom pull react back core right",-0.01027197440240919,0.4709533220402786
2015-02-25 19:42:46,"Which is why I proposed that UI: it works automatically. While using the system, it simply indicates to you as you compose the message &quot;Yes, the email address you are sending mail to belongs to the person you intend to message&quot; or &quot;No, that email address belongs to someone else&quot; or &quot;This is a brand new email address.&quot; This way when you are emailing your lawyer to set up a will, or you email your accountant with your tax info, you can be sure that (a) you are emailing just the right person and (b) that only they can read the communication.<p>While setting up the system, you are simply required to link your identity. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, GMail, HN, the government all should allow you to easily link your identity. This should be a normal part of your account creation (this can tie in nicely with another change: getting rid of passwords and using a browser UI for identifying yourself a la Persona, but PGP based).  Basically when signing up for Twitter, it should optionally let you upload one of your public keys (via a nice browser UI no less). Twitter (Facebook, GMail, etc.) would then expose a nice API for querying by public key fingerprint: &quot;Who has 0xDEADBEEF?&quot; =&gt; &quot;@DeadBeef&quot;. Revocation, key updates, all that should be automatic: you revoke your public key and issue a replacement, all your services update automatically.<p>This is the point where lots of people will raise concerns about privacy: &quot;This means Twitter now must have access to my GMail account! WTF?!&quot;. No. This process must be voluntary and optional. If you want to have 200 different identities online, go for it. I don&#x27;t care to know your real name, I just care to know that I am talking only to the person I intend to talk to. Think emailing a well known developer on GitHub, having never met them.

This allows you to prove that github.com&#x2F;example is @example on Twitter, example@example.com, example@gmail.com, and HN user &quot;example&quot;.<p>And the benefit to &quot;regular Joe&quot; is that when he emails his accountant, he can now send his credit card number and SSN without fear of eavesdropping.",Facebook,propos ui work automat use system simpli indic compos messag quot ye email address send mail belong person intend messag quot quot email address belong someon els quot quot brand new email address quot way email lawyer set email account tax info sure email right person b read commun <p> set system simpli requir link ident twitter facebook linkedin gmail hn govern allow easili link ident normal part account creation tie nice anoth chang get rid password use browser ui identifi la persona pgp base basic sign twitter option let upload one public key nice browser ui less twitter facebook gmail etc would expos nice api queri public key fingerprint quot 0 xdeadbeef quot gt quot @deadbeef quot revoc key updat automat revok public key issu replac servic updat automat <p> point lot peopl rais concern privaci quot mean twitter must access gmail account wtf quot process must voluntari option want 200 differ ident onlin go #x27 care know real name care know talk person intend talk think email well known develop github never met #x27 need real name interest far publish oss github allow prove github com #x2f exampl @exampl twitter exampl @exampl com exampl @gmail com hn user quot exampl quot <p> benefit quot regular joe quot email account send credit card number ssn without fear eavesdrop,0.06925701110483716,0.6210973205538423
2015-02-24 13:28:09,"&gt; There comes a point when it&#x27;s just no longer practical to store the entire blockchain<p>Why would you have to? The point of decentralisation is not that everyone has a copy of the truth. It&#x27;s that a sufficient number of nodes have a copy of the truth, such that you can check a number of them and easily verify the veracity of the data. Many blockchain applications run not by querying their own blockchain but rather querying a number of trusted sources via their API. Coinbase, Bitpay, Chain.com, Blockcypher etc all offer APIs to interface with their blockchain nodes and others.<p>It&#x27;s like saying Facebook will never work because you can&#x27;t possible store the worlds&#x27; photos on everyone&#x27;s smartphones. You don&#x27;t have to, Facebook stores it on their server. Similarly we will see, and already see, dedicated servers that store the blockchain, and as long as you have enough independent ones you can maintain decentralisation just as if you were hosting your own node.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no need to host the blockchain on small embedded devices any more than any other data, like music or photos we normally host on dedicated servers instead.<p>&gt; but truncating the chain (or only storing some kind of &quot;working set&quot;) isn&#x27;t feasible either.<p>Yes it is. What makes you say it isn&#x27;t? Pruning the blockchain is something that&#x27;s currently being worked on.<p>The idea is that if I send you $1 a million times and you send it back $1m times, every day, for the next 1 billion years, we could either store terabytes and terabytes of data of all these transactions, or we could store the end result (= no change occurred) and the last couple weeks of transaction data. The rest can be pruned. Because each block has a hash of all its transactions, and this hash is used to mine the next block (hence a chain of blocks, blockchain), we needn&#x27;t store each individual transaction, we have the hash to verify the truth of transactions.<p>We might have some universities saving all transactions for posterity &amp; research, and some businesses for data mining, but the vast majorities of nodes that just need to secure the network can indeed, without security issues, not store long-spent outputs. (i.e. bitcoins that have already been spent many times over. e.g. if I give a dollar to you and you give it to the next guy, and he to the next girl, and so on 100 times, at that point there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to store on every node the fact I gave a dollar to you for the security of the network.)<p>&gt; Not to mention the gargantuan download that&#x27;s required for that initial setup to get up to date with the latest network transactions.<p>Again, no need to have all redundant transactions. The pruned blockchain would currently be under a gigabyte large. Second, headers-first has already been implemented which made the initial setup much, much faster.<p>Beyond that, we mustn&#x27;t forget that the average American makes 2 transactions a day. And one such transaction is about 400 bytes or so, in bitcoin. If you compare this to tweets, or an hour of netflix, it&#x27;s puny. If you count up all the data, it&#x27;s about $8 to store one day of all of US consumer transactions on a retail harddrive. Imagine the cost of storage for Mastercard for one of their nodes was $8, and instead of just powering a fraction of US retail, they&#x27;d literally handle every single transaction by themselves and store them all for $8. Even if you wanted to have thousands of nodes and store the last year of data (and given the velocity of money, you wouldn&#x27;t have to as again, you can prune data after money has been spent a couple times), that&#x27;s a puny amount of money to power an entire consumer financial system of the world&#x27;s biggest economy. And given storage, like CPU and bandwidth, on a 50-60% yoy growth rate (Kryders, Moore&#x27;s and Nielsen&#x27;s laws), I think by the time bitcoin becomes important enough to run 100% of US retail (which is likely never, but hypothetically speaking), that $8 will have dropped to below $0.10 easily.<p>I know I&#x27;m taking big shortcuts here but this is just to illustrate the economics are extremely favorable today and in the future. I don&#x27;t know if bitcoin will succeed or fail, but I&#x27;m pretty near certain it won&#x27;t fail because storage&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;bandwidth isn&#x27;t affordable enough for nodes to make it viable to run the network. I and many others have looked into this quite a bit and these aren&#x27;t big problems. Bitcoin has big obstacles (no gigantic consumer benefits in a world of decent fintech like every OECD country to use bitcoin directly, is one), but storage probably isn&#x27;t one of em.",Facebook,"gt come point #x27 longer practic store entir blockchain <p> would point decentralis everyon copi truth #x27 suffici number node copi truth check number easili verifi verac data mani blockchain applic run queri blockchain rather queri number trust sourc api coinbas bitpay chain com blockcyph etc offer api interfac blockchain node other <p> #x27 like say facebook never work #x27 possibl store world #x27 photo everyon #x27 smartphon #x27 facebook store server similarli see alreadi see dedic server store blockchain long enough independ one maintain decentralis host node <p> #x27 absolut need host blockchain small embed devic data like music photo normal host dedic server instead <p> gt truncat chain store kind quot work set quot ;) #x27 feasibl either <p> ye make say #x27 prune blockchain someth #x27 current work <p> idea send 1 million time send back 1 time everi day next 1 billion year could either store terabyt terabyt data transact could store end result chang occur last coupl week transact data rest prune block hash transact hash use mine next block henc chain block blockchain #x27 store individu transact hash verifi truth transact <p> might univers save transact poster amp research busi data mine vast major node need secur network inde without secur issu store long-spent output e bitcoin alreadi spent mani time e g give dollar give next guy next girl 100 time point #x27 absolut reason store everi node fact gave dollar secur network <p> gt mention gargantuan download #x27 requir initi setup get date latest network transact <p> need redund transact prune blockchain would current gigabyt larg second headers-first alreadi implement made initi setup much much faster <p> beyond #x27 forget averag american make 2 transact day one transact 400 byte bitcoin compar tweet hour netflix #x27 puni count data #x27 8 store one day us consum transact retail harddriv imagin cost storag mastercard one node 8, instead power fraction us retail #x27 ;d liter handl everi singl transact store 8 even want thousand node store last year data given veloc money #x27 prune data money spent coupl time #x27 puni amount money power entir consum financi system world #x27 biggest economi given storag like cpu bandwidth 50 60 yoy growth rate kryder moor #x27 nielsen #x27 law think time bitcoin becom import enough run 100 us retail like never hypothet speak 8 drop 0.10 easili <p> know #x27 take big shortcut illustr econom extrem favor today futur #x27 know bitcoin succeed fail #x27 pretti near certain #x27 fail storag #x2f cpu #x2f bandwidth #x27 afford enough node make viabl run network mani other look quit bit #x27 big problem bitcoin big obstacl gigant consum benefit world decent fintech like everi oecd countri use bitcoin directli one storag probabl #x27 one em",0.01231812169312169,0.3519841269841269

2014-11-20 19:57:12,"Facebook, the product, is no longer this super sexy app that college kids are checking out. Looking for Facebook to be that, you will probably predict its future demise.<p>But that&#x27;s not what Facebook <i>is</i> anymore. Facebook is the social graph expressed in Internet form, and is so interwoven with the fabric of the Internet that it&#x27;s difficult to avoid, even if you&#x27;re intentionally doing so.<p>Some products phase in and out, that&#x27;s for sure. I think Zuck&#x27;s realized the potential for that to happen, and once he got on the top of the totem pole began preparing for it. He turned FB from an app into a social graph and API that is everywhere, and now he&#x27;s paying from $1B (Instagram) to $19B (WhatsApp) to get some of his biggest would-be enemies to join him. He does not screw around with the Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit I <i>despise</i> my current Facebook feed. It&#x27;s full of clickbait articles mingled with the occasional update from someone whom I may or may not care about. That being said, I have tried to delete Facebook multiple times, and to no avail. I still have my hopes that they&#x27;ll change the algorithm a bit and kill the effectiveness of the clickbait to the same extent they killed the spamminess of those social games and widgets. (Although they still exist and are annoying, they&#x27;re an order of magnitude less annoying than they used to be.) But, despite my best efforts to avoid it, I still check my Facebook feed at least daily.<p>What pulled me back? At first, it was that Facebook was integrated with Spotify. I had to create a new account and build up all of my playlists, songs, etc. from scratch. That was kind of a pain. Then I deleted Facebook again. I ended up missing a party that was <i>only</i> planned on Facebook. Then I missed the news that a friend was engaged, and another friend was pregnant. Then I couldn&#x27;t log into my Kiva account to redistribute the repayments I had received because I had used Facebook to sign up. Facebook is just an incredibly, incredibly sticky product. Network effects are a bitch.<p>Sure, hackers will say, &quot;Well your friends should have called you instead of putting it on Facebook.&quot; But they didn&#x27;t. Even though I&#x27;m not in college, if I&#x27;m not on Facebook I&#x27;m missing the party. (Even though &quot;the party&quot; is now simply knowing that my friend finished med school and is moving to Michigan.)<p>Facebook isn&#x27;t as sexy as it used to be, but it has become increasingly difficult to avoid. Think about that - we have to figure out ways and work hard to <i>avoid</i> a product. That&#x27;s why a significant proportion of the Internet&#x27;s users log in to Facebook <i>every day</i>.

It really depends on the framework, timing of things, people behind it. Angular is by Google, but also Google is pushing Web Components at the same time, which can integrate with Angular 2, but it challenges it as well. Also with Angular 2&#x27;s goals being known for a long time, anyone could tell that ES6 would be a dramatic wave of change to the framework.<p>With JS, all the frameworks and libraries out there are just a few years old. Angular is about 5 years old, but Google doesn&#x27;t even use Angular in their sites, which should be extremely telling (along with the complexity learning and figuring out the API).

2014-07-14 02:11:22,"Wow, you are all over this thread. I take issue with the way you are jumping in here with a lot of assumptions. Please give me a moment to respond to your assertions point by point.<p>There is nothing glamorous about airing our faults and where we went wrong along the way, the points you enumerate were our beliefs to a &#x27;T&#x27; when we launched our second product a year and a half ago. A handful of these are right while others are mostly wrong or misguided.<p>1) This is a tough one to address. I see elsewhere in this thread you made the same mistake we did - namely thinking we could get 2mA with PS-POLL. While possible in the lab, that is simply not the case when working under conditions we&#x27;ve seen in the wild. Hypothetically if that were true you could see near instantaneous WiFi all the time. We were optimistic this may be possible but didn&#x27;t want to bet on it. We made the call that WiFi is advertised with instant response when someone is at the door and delayed response when in power save mode. If there is confusion we are quick to correct on Facebook, Twitter, and even our own blog[1]. Firmware updates to our WiFi chipset look promising but we are not committing to this.<p>2) Determining intent is a hard problem but hardly a fool&#x27;s errand. We don&#x27;t do this through just one BLE radio using RSSI alone as your comment implies[2]. The examples you give are both solvable with what we&#x27;ve built today. The harder problems come from platform inconsistency between iPhone and Android API&#x27;s. Android for instance only recently announced BLE support and when they did, the phone could only operate in one out of the two roles. Clearly other companies think similar home vs away intent is worth developing too[3][4].<p>3) Building a proper prototype without functional mechanicals is insane. Don&#x27;t do this. The other huge rabbit hole here is the word &#x27;reliably.&#x27; It&#x27;s like a client of a web design firm asking for 100% uptime.[5] The best you should do at the &#x27;hardware startup making a prototype&#x27; phase is to get it working on your target platform and solve known bugs so it works for 90 to 99.9% with loose specs or 100% of the time under tight optimal conditions. That said, things change. The way we were doing BLE security when we launched was thought to be secure. A ShmooCon talk instilled some doubts that while not broken it may not be the best foundation [6]. We rebuilt a lot of that with Diffie-Hellman and HMAC instead. We saw some connectivity issues with the new approach that were subsequently addressed. Other things change too. Our BLE chip switched from not using signed licenses to using signed licenses between updates. This caused us a bunch of frustration.<p>4) 40 hours of work to review a design is probably too little. We spent closer to 300 hours on the EE side with the most senior hacker we knew [7]. We worked with another firm on mechanics for 11 months prior to launch. In retrospect that feels about right for how much weight mechanical problems are vs electrical.<p>That $25-$30 number you site IS misleading. As an analogy, it is almost certainly possible to build a robot which can walk a straight line across a plastic table for this but getting it to walk across arbitrary terrain will cost you if your operating specs are unbounded (think Mars rover.) We know how to build a device that fits over locks for $25 without PCB - we are not happy with what level of performance that gets us.<p>5) This product however is not designed to be a replacement lock. We have made one of those in the past[8]. Saying something is wrong&#x2F;inefficient is true for anything asked to do something other than what it is made for. This model of Lockitron is designed to fit over a wide variety of existing locks precisely so that it can work for renters who can not change their locks. It is designed to do it in a way that it does not requires you to take your lock apart so it can be installed quickly and with next to zero mechanical aptitude. It does these things insanely well.<p>The numbers you site for gear vendors are again misleading. Yes, one can get gears for this cost in this time but you are shifting the burden of development and tooling elsewhere. Making this tradeoff in this case gets us towards a local maxima that is not the product&#x27;s desired function.<p>6) This is a bit naive. You don&#x27;t build to the spec if you&#x27;re seeing different results in the field. We saw this to be the case with sticky locks and jammy door frames. Other new locks can be put on a clean installation, we have to work with what&#x27;s there. Similarly, the Bluetooth 4.0 and 4.1 specs promise a lot of things which neither Apple nor Android support. In this case we build for what effects our customers experience not a certification checkbox - especially when that means exceeding the certifications standards.<p>And if anything that is the takeaway here. Building something to spec is a finite task with an estimable amount of work and calculable delivery date. Having real world conditions conflict with what was spec&#x27;ed introduces delays. Having conflicts across your product from metals and plastics up to software interfaces means these delays propagate.<p>You make the tough calls. You ship.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.lockitron.com/post/84539548097/debugging-jams-wifi-battery-notifications""

2014-05-20 18:14:53,"<i>I&#x27;ll certainly grant that the latter comes with a body of current programming practice and infrastructure, but that hardly an endorsement of its relative quality or suitability for the job-to-be-done.</i><p>You don&#x27;t see &quot;comes with a body of current programming practice and infrastructure&quot; as an endorsement for &quot;suitability for the job-to-be-done&quot;? :)  It doesn&#x27;t bear directly on the main discussion we&#x27;re having, but for people who are trying to get things done, I would say it&#x27;s quite a strong endorsement of a particular practice to say that we understand how to apply it successfully and that there are tools, known patterns, and infrastructure around it.<p>Verifying authorization on a set of operations is hard or easy depending on what the operations are.  High-level operations that correspond to the actions that users are presented with in the user interface tend to be easy to secure and validate.  Low-level database operations tend to be hard to secure and validate as your data model becomes complicated, because you basically have to reverse-engineer the high-level operation that licensed the low-level operations (which could be many and spread across different tables).<p>I think the best way to expose a Facebook wall (say) via CRDT is to define a Wall datatype whose operations are the permitted high-level actions you can take on a wall.  Then they are easy to validate, as you say.  This is sort of how Google Docs is implemented -- the core of the application consumes high-level operations (insert column, sort rows, etc.) from different users and updates the document state, and then this core is replicated in different data centers.  Most discussions I&#x27;ve seen seem to assume that CRDT and OT operations are simple, generic operations, but I think the real magic is in treating it as a paradigm like OO and defining datatypes within it.<p>I still have a hard time conceptualizing an API call as a timeless, commutative modification to a model.  I love CRDT and OT, but I&#x27;ve just seen too many network APIs to put them in a box.  Meteor actually has more shared data model between client and server than any other framework I know of.  The general case of APIs, for us, is you tell the server to go do something, and it tells you when it&#x27;s done it, and you also get streaming updates for the parts of the data model you care about (and a marker telling at what point the changes you caused landed).<p>Basically my main point is that you still need high-level verbs that carry intent, whether they are API calls or operations.  Otherwise you have data changing and no accounting for it.  It&#x27;s like how banking is mainly about transactions, not about telling each other how much money is in account X or Y.",Facebook,<i> #x27 certainli grant latter come bodi current program practic infrastructur hardli endors rel qualiti suitabl job-to-be-don </i> <p> #x27 see quot come bodi current program practic infrastructur quot endors quot suitabl job-to-be-don quot :) #x27 bear directli main discuss #x27 peopl tri get thing done would say #x27 quit strong endors particular practic say understand appli success tool known pattern infrastructur around <p> verifi author set oper hard easi depend oper high-level oper correspond action user present user interfac tend easi secur valid low-level databas oper tend hard secur valid data model becom complic basic reverse-engin high-level oper licens low-level oper could mani spread across differ tabl <p> think best way expos facebook wall say crdt defin wall datatyp whose oper permit high-level action take wall easi valid say sort googl doc implement core applic consum high-level oper insert column sort row etc differ user updat document state core replic differ data center discuss #x27 seen seem assum crdt ot oper simpl gener oper think real magic treat paradigm like oo defin datatyp within <p> still hard time conceptu api call timeless commut modif model love crdt ot #x27 seen mani network api put box meteor actual share data model client server framework know gener case api us tell server go someth tell #x27 done also get stream updat part data model care marker tell point chang caus land <p> basic main point still need high-level verb carri intent whether api call oper otherwis data chang account #x27 like bank mainli transact tell much money account x,0.14818840579710144,0.34384057971014487

A user logs in, is provided with a signed access token by FB, and then uses that token to prove to an application that the owner of the secret key has granted them permission.

However, I have two small problems and one large problem with it:<p>- It&#x27;s impossible to go back and select another payment option once you click one of them.<p>- You can&#x27;t style your payment dialog. (This may be a good thing [consistency], but I think it&#x27;d be nice to be able to add custom CSS to the pricing dialog.)<p>My large problem is that the price is crazy; your 50 cent per transaction fee means that for all transactions under $7 you collect more in fees than Stripe does. With a $5 payment - very common for services such as the one I&#x27;ll release soon - I&#x27;m paying 20% to you. With a $1 payment, I pay a prohibitive 83% in fees. That&#x27;s a really large cut compared to using the Stripe API directly, and I think that for anyone looking to increase their profits it&#x27;s a no-brainer to cut Snappy Checkout out of the equation.<p>To give a personal example, my service will be primarily receiving $5 payments. For the first 1000 payments or so, I&#x27;ll probably stick with Snappy - the $500 I give up isn&#x27;t worth the time I would&#x27;ve spent rolling my own solution. However, as soon as I can see that there&#x27;s a clear market for my product, I&#x27;ll roll my own with Stripe - I clearly wouldn&#x27;t want to give up 20% to payment processing alone.<p>Meanwhile, Frank is selling antique vases on Facebook for $1.5k each, and he pays 50 cents a transaction to you.<p>However, if you were to switch to a flat fee + a percentage (say 1.5% and 15 cents), as Stripe does, you would probably retain my business for a lot longer. Suddenly, I pay a 4.5% cut to you as opposed to a 10% cut, which is quite reasonable. At the same time, Frank the antique vase seller doesn&#x27;t really care about a 1.5% fee: a win-win situation.<p>tl;dr I recommend that you change to a percentage of the total sales: sellers of cheap items will use your service and sellers of expensive items won&#x27;t care.

2014-01-27 20:57:53,"The article brings up a good point, sometimes it makes more sense to start with the person. For example, let&#x27;s say I need to get in touch with my friend to quickly inform them of a change to our plans.<p>Open Skype? Not online. Check Facebook, nope, they&#x27;re not on. Messenger? Nope. Ok, I&#x27;ll open my contact book, and get their number to call.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to simply select the person I&#x27;m trying to reach, and see what platforms they&#x27;re online, so I can choose my contact method?<p>Or what if I want to see what&#x27;s new with one friend?

2014-01-01 14:42:12,"I&#x27;ve been playing with Facebook&#x27;s React to make an internal interactive resource scheduling system for our company.  So far I think I&#x27;m getting it... and am thrilled with how it works.<p>React eschews the attempt to split the View &#x2F; ModelView that are the hallmark of most full-service frameworks. Instead of this separation, React applications are built by defining reusable, nested components, each having a render() method that mixes binding and logic to build sub-parts of a web page using their custom DOM.  Each component has an internal mutable state and a set of read-only properties it gets from its parent context. In React, &quot;data binding&quot; is just part of rendering.<p>Since React owns the DOM, it&#x27;s incompatible with JQuery; or rather, if you use JQuery, you could do it in a leaf node and manage the boundary carefully.  React tracks things by using a hierarchical identifier, each key unique within each level of the structure.  It then has a predictable&#x2F;fast algorithem for detecting changes and updating the DOM.  Unless you provide your own component keys (used to build the DOM id) all the way down, you need to use CSS classes (rather than IDs).<p>Finally, I&#x27;d say, React really seems like a library -- and one that has a low API to functionality ratio.

2013-11-20 14:39:05,"I would say that people, and their reasons for objecting to surveillance or having privacy concerns far are more complicated and varied than you are imagining.  Some of the people who have expressed concerns may be:<p>Citizens concerned about government officials overstepping constitutional bounds and lying about it, but not particularly concerned about the practical consequences of the surveillance.<p>Activists for whom NSA surveillance confirms that government  is not on the side of the people, but whose sense of history leads them to the conclusion that if massive FBI files, Jim Crow laws, and lynching did not stop the Civil Rights movement, metadata is unlikely to prevent the arc of history bending towards justice.<p>“Airbus nationalists” in Europe who are, in their heart, more concerned about the fact the EU seems to be incapable of developing a Facebook, Google, Twitter, ect.

2013-11-17 07:30:39,"A comment I left a few weekends ago, which addressed the same topic but before the Youtube&#x2F;G+ story broke: [0]<p>&quot;Hijacking the top comment to talk about a big concern I have. This EFF article argues that there&#x27;s a place for Anonymity on the Internet [1], and I think most of us agree (especially if we emphathize with those in Iran, China, Syria, and the like).<p>But what HNers must realize is the following: The mainstream Internet <i>can not become</i> the Tor-visited Dark-Net (which restores anonymity) that many believe is inevitable WITHOUT losing its positive sociological impact. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, even HN rely on anonymity and also provide a great deal of such value.  Here&#x27;s a simple example of &#x27;sociological impact&#x27;: CNN (FoxNews, etc) pays attention to what the top links on Reddit are, because the site is in the public&#x27;s face -- and: the people have a collective voice.<p>Next: Without the perception of anonymity, sites like Reddit will stop flourishing.<p>Let&#x27;s go deeper:  Reddit&#x27;s culture thrives on &quot;anonymity&quot; in the form of throwaway accounts and people being themselves without representing themselves.  Throwaway accounts (heard of &#x27;Cation Bot&#x27; or &#x27;AWildSketchAppeared&#x27;?) are a form of expression unique to environments which allow for anonymity (pseudonyms). Who&#x27;s to say novelty accounts would be as risque or hilarious without anonymity?  Certainly these sites flourish because users feel comfortable playing a part and taking a chance.<p>There are two issues at play which threaten anonymity on Reddit. Now obvious (in light of Snowden&#x27;s leaks): 1.) Reddit usernames can, and probably are, being mapped to peoples&#x27; actual identity. ... Not as obvious: 2.) Users&#x27; up and down votes, even private messages, can also be sniffed with ease.<p>Reddit&#x27;s&#x27; devteam has retreated from the idea of providing HTTPS for its voting&#x2F;web API [2], so people&#x27;s actions (aside from comments) can be mapped as well. I tried to raise awareness of this issue five months ago [3].  I know there&#x27;s an argument to be made that SSL&#x2F;HTTPS is useless anyway (just use Tor!, they say), but the bigger question remains:<p>Can a mainstream community such as Reddit exist in tomorrow&#x27;s Internet?  I&#x27;d say that such web-societies are fragile -- likely targets of dragnet surveillance and subversion, especially given their disruptive nature.<p>People and the press are paranoid about Facebook&#x2F;Google privacy because its users (are encouraged to) identify themselves <i>explicitly</i>, but the reality is no different with sites like Reddit - just the perception. Just think about how much more is shared on a site like Reddit by its members because of their pseudonyms! Few people aside from the avid Tor-using&#x2F;&#x2F;r&#x2F;netsec crowd have realized this.<p>Reddit is the internet &quot;as we know it,&quot; and I feel the Internet is about to change.<p>In hindsight - Google&#x27;s initial &quot;no pseudonyms&quot; policy for Google+ was prescient -- though the company eventually capitulated to popular demand for them.

2013-11-04 05:17:38,"&gt; There&#x27;s also poor testability, inability to re-use functions that reference the request internally, inability to statically analyze dependencies (less of an issue in Python, since the lack of types makes it hard to analyze them anyway), additional context that the developer must keep in his head, and inability to cross-reference parameters &amp; call-sites and identify where a given variable is coming from in code browsers or debuggers.<p>I don&#x27;t know. Most of them seem like a non issue to me. Shouldn&#x27;t the api cover that testability(of request)? At least, it does in Flask. Re-using a function which uses request won&#x27;t be any different from re-using a function which uses datetime. I do get your point about difficulty of analyzing Python owing to dynamic typing and monkey patching, but I couldn&#x27;t connect it to context local. As for cross referencing, you just treat request as you treat datetime.<p>&gt; Singletons are no better - if you dress it up as RequestManager.get_current_request(), it&#x27;s just as bad. If you don&#x27;t understand why something is a bad idea, complying with the letter of the law without complying with the spirit doesn&#x27;t really get you much.<p>I won&#x27;t do that. That is just a tongue in cheek comment to appease &quot;death to globals&quot; police.<p>&gt; Now I want my programs to do as little as possible and have access to as little as possible.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with that but assuming that the request object is available for the request lifecycle is pretty reasonable.<p>&gt; Usually I end up pulling out the values I want inside the view function and calling any helpers using only those values, so I don&#x27;t pass the request around anyway.<p>You don&#x27;t pass around request in a general workflow(why would you?).

This does a post save signal when a new user registers. I need to send a welcome mail to the user asking him to activate his account. I need request.build_absolute_uri to construct the uri, and guess what, I don&#x27;t have request in the callback and I don&#x27;t have a way to obtain it. Now there can be other ways I can solve it - configure sites and generate url using sites; simply have the base url in settings and construct the url by doing a urljoin; may be in some alternate universe, django&#x27;s reverse generates external url. But the thing is, I have needed access to request object on more than a few occasions. Granted if the callback passed me the request object, it won&#x27;t have been an issue but it doesn&#x27;t and I had to resort to thread local middleware to save the request object.<p>&gt; A fourth was that I worked a bunch with both systems and found that adding a parameter to each function along a call path is easy<p>The issue is apis which you haven&#x27;t wrote.

These websites represent breakthroughs in sociology: memes; open, real-time, transnational,  popular (upvote&#x2F;downvote, retweetable) discourse.<p>It&#x27;s not an understatement to say that Reddit, Twitter, even H.N. are some of the greatest manifestations of the Internet-age -- look at the impact they have had on mainstream media and raising the bar for popular discourse.<p>(Ex.1: I would argue that the Snowden revelations would not have persisted in the public conscious nearly as long if it hadn&#x27;t been for Reddit&#x27;s continued rage. \nEx.2: As it is, news outlets hawk Reddit&#x2F;HN for story-material, and build the story&#x27;s narrative with Twitter.)<p>But what HNers must realize is that: The mainstream Internet __can not become__ the Tor-visited Dark-Net that many believe is inevitable -- WITHOUT losing its positive sociological impact.<p>Yet without the perception of anonymity, sites like Reddit will stop flourishing.<p>Reddit&#x27;s culture thrives on anonymity, throwaway accounts, and people being themselves without representing themselves.<p>There are two issues at play. Now obvious: 1.) Reddit usernames can be mapped to people&#x27;s actual identity. Not as obvious: 2.) Users up and down votes can also be mapped to their identity.  Reddit as a dev-team has retreated from the idea of providing HTTPS for its voting&#x2F;web API, so people&#x27;s actions (aside from comments) can be mapped as well. I tried to raise this point 5 months ago [3]. I know there&#x27;s an argument to be made that SSL&#x2F;HTTPS is useless anyway (just use Tor!, they say), but the bigger question remains:<p>Can a mainstream community like Reddit exist in tomorrow&#x27;s Internet?<p>People and the press are paranoid about Facebook&#x2F;Google privacy because its users identify themselves explicitly, but the reality is no different with sites like Reddit - just the perception.  Just think about how much more is shared on a site like Reddit by its members because of their pseudonyms!\nFew people aside from the avid Tor users have realized this.<p>Reddit is the internet &quot;as we know it,&quot; and I feel the Internet is about to change.<p>In hindsight - Google&#x27;s initial &quot;no pseudonyms&quot; policy for Google+ was prescient -- though the company eventually capitulated to popular demand for them. [4] Perhaps they wished to save each of us the unsavory realization that aliases exist in name-only (pun intended). :&#x2F;<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/online-anonymity-not-only-trolls-and-political-dissidents"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;online-anonymity-not-o...</a> \n[3] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n73s0/again_reddit_needs_fullsite_https/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1n73s0&#x2F;again_reddit...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-aliases-399584"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibtimes.com&#x2F;google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-...</a>",Facebook,"updat comment #x27 edit #x27 disabl quot devil bill alway detail quot line saw articl headlin techmem quot feinstein releas fake nsa reform bill actual tri legal illeg nsa bulk data collect quot 1 pretti shameless part #x27 hn item <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6653190"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f news ycombin com #x2f item id 6653190 </a> <p> 1 <a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131031/12394625090/feinstein-releases-fake-nsa-reform-bill-actually-tries-to-legalize-illegal-nsa-bulk-data-collection.shtml"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f www techdirt com #x2f articl #x2f 20131031 #x2f 12394625090 #x2f feinst </a> <p> <p> websit like reddit hn extrem vulner <p> hijack comment talk big concern mine eff articl argu #x27 place anonym internet 2 think us agre especi emphath iran china syria like <p> anonym also key websit like reddit twitter includ hn websit repres breakthrough sociolog meme open real-tim transnat popular upvot #x2f ;d ownvot retweet discours <p> #x27 understat say reddit twitter even h n greatest manifest internet-ag look impact mainstream media rais bar popular discours <p> ex 1 would argu snowden revel would persist public consciou nearli long #x27 reddit #x27 continu rage nex 2 news outlet hawk reddit #x2f hn story-materi build stori #x27 narr twitter <p> hner must realiz mainstream internet __can becom __ tor-visit dark-net mani believ inevit without lose posit sociolog impact <p> yet without percept anonym site like reddit stop flourish <p> reddit #x27 cultur thrive anonym throwaway account peopl without repres <p> two issu play obviou 1 reddit usernam map peopl #x27 actual ident obviou 2 user vote also map ident reddit dev-team retreat idea provid http vote #x2f web api peopl #x27 action asid comment map well tri rais point 5 month ago 3 know #x27 argument made ssl #x2f http useless anyway use tor say bigger question remain <p> mainstream commun like reddit exist tomorrow #x27 internet <p> peopl press paranoid facebook #x2f googl privaci user identifi explicitli realiti differ site like reddit percept think much share site like reddit member pseudonym nfew peopl asid avid tor user realiz <p> reddit internet quot know quot feel internet chang <p> hindsight googl #x27 initi quot pseudonym quot polici googl prescient though compani eventu capitul popular demand 4 perhap wish save us unsavori realiz alias exist name-onli pun intend #x2f <p> 2 <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/online-anonymity-not-only-trolls-and-political-dissidents"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f www eff org #x2f ;d eeplink #x2f 2013 #x2f 10 #x2f ;o nline-anonymity-not-o </a> n 3 <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n73s0/again_reddit_needs_fullsite_https/"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f www reddit com #x2f r #x2f ;p rivaci #x2f comment #x2f 1 n73s0 #x2f again_reddit </a> n 4 <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-aliases-399584"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f www ibtim com #x2f google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonym </a>",0.1388888888888889,0.5092592592592593

But it wasn&#x27;t because there was no damn standard for that, just proprietary APIs as various people wanted to lock you into their cloud service. The standards that have emerged have been, of course, ones that generally involve lock-in to proprietary platforms, like OAuth.<p>[1] interestingly many of the new generation of web developers seem to dislike RSS.",Facebook,sinc #x27 web #x27 involv give away sourc code charg peopl thing googl open sourc search engin let anybodi advertis site free #x27 look <p> realli #x27 understand meme web #x27 ;op en #x27 much nativ desktop softwar use open sourc practic none web servic use open sourc much chanc #x27 gnu project #x27 web e reimplement open googl twitter facebook open sourc web servic signific far come control data usual best get proprietari api may may get shut chang tomorrow <p> web gave us rss good 1 sinc pretti much non stop stream proprietari api platform lock-in even thing built rss tend proprietari api rather open standard take googl reader exampl shut trivial pull subscript point client new replac rss-sync server like email client #x27 damn standard proprietari api variou peopl want lock cloud servic standard emerg cours one gener involv lock-in proprietari platform like oauth <p> 1 interestingli mani new gener web develop seem dislik rss,0.14856459330143537,0.3925837320574162

There should be some central hub for research and exchange ;)<p>Disconnected knowledge-islands with people not knowing about already existing solutions to problems they are trying to solve seems to be one downside of scattered communities.<p>Decentralization is needed for private communication, but there are downsides - creating x parallel nets will not help in finding each others - the knowledge evolution of the internet is driven by the desire of the human brain to connect all available information.<p>Imagine the NSA decided to create an open and freely available API to the centralized information they have collected - good-minded people certainly will extract useful knowledge from that data, possibly world-changing new ways of thinking about everything could be the results.<p>The human brain wants this central intelligence (the real one, not the agency) to solve the evolutionary problems we are confronted with today - it must be seen as an ironical evidence of this need that the first biggest data collections that might be useful for all humans on this planet are collected exclusively by paranoid psychopaths to have better tools for control and oppression.<p>But even if misused, it does happen - the human brain wants to connect. It will not be happy with decentralized knowledge - it is the reason, why the internet exists and it will not want to go back.<p>This does not mean that decentralized networks are a bad thing in itself (as I said before, needed for private talk urgently!), but it means that we need some information harvesting entity that makes it easy to connect.<p>It is not only marketing what makes google and facebook so successful - it is the biological meta-programming of our brains that make us want to use these possibilities to connect to the global information pool.<p>The global brain is the destination - of course it should be untouchable by insane sadist that want to control our life. This evolutionary force will lead to social changes - it does already.<p>Re-Decentralizing the internet, from this point of view, only postpones the real challenge: build technical and social systems, that can not be misused or at least make it easier to detect and eliminate misuse - we have already concepts for this, we need to apply. Real-life IDS will warn you if you consume fake information or are following the wrong leaders (or if you are following at all). Real-life social SIEM will prevent a group of people misusing the system just for their own profits.

2013-10-11 23:45:42,"Just how many of these shops are there that have been registering your bikes and how many bikes have they registered for you?<p>Do you have any idea about POS systems?<p>Because of how the industry for POS has developed (fragmented) you cannot guarantee that a POS system is online - it talks to a server in the back office and that code was written aeons before the acronym API came into parlance.<p>Shops stick with legacy POS systems because they have a database of customers and stock on there. To migrate to the all singing and all dancing POS system that will work with your system is not at all as straightforward or as likely to happen as you imagine. Staff training, hardware (to open the drawer and get the scanner working), cost of new software - it is just not going to happen, no matter how clumsy and visual-basic-y it is. There are even small bike shops that don&#x27;t have POS!!!<p>You are in cloud cuckoo land if you think for one moment that you are ever going to get POS systems in bike shops to talk to your web service. Sure one or two hipster-shops in Chicago run by your mate who wrote his own POS system in Ruby on Rails with loads of angular.js one weekend, but I think you haven&#x27;t any option but to completely forget about it for the majority of bike shops - even large chains with decent IT departments - it is so not realistic what you are talking about.<p>I haven&#x27;t bought a Specialized for a while, however, historically, their manuals have been out of date. This goes for every other brand going and this has been the case for the last 25 years - yes I was mechanic 25 years ago so I know these things. Nobody watches DVD&#x27;s by the way, do they?<p>People do read the manuals, not always and not cover to cover. With a bicycle what else do you do when you get home with a new one and it is gone dark - read the manual! Maybe not in Chicago, but, enthusiastic owners with a new pride and joy certainly do give the manual some attention. If it was spruced up with some online registration thingamy in there then think how much easier it could be. So I think you are being deliberately irksome by flippantly saying that nobody reads the manual - that is not a certainty. If the manual included a cheque for a million dollars in the back then I am sure that even people that cannot read would read the manual. If, like the UK brands I know, the manual is not exactly scintillating then it gets picked over and cast aside.<p>With the manual approach you get two bites at the cherry - in the shop by your mates in Chicago and, for everywhere else, something people can be prompted to do from the comfort of their own home.<p>You are being cynical thinking customers don&#x27;t want to be marketed to. In an age when people put so much cr4p about themselves on Facebook etc. The guarantee&#x2F;warranty form as means of building up a customer database has worked for at least a century. It is a trick but then it isn&#x27;t perceived as a trick by people outside your bit of Chicago. If there is something in it for the customer - an actual warranty - they don&#x27;t hesitate to sign up. It is that simple. Just make it online.<p>For any scheme such as yours to work it really does need to work for all stakeholders and involve all stakeholders. That means the customer, law enforcement, the retailers, the distributors, the manufacturers and the trade organisations (at retail and manufacturer level). What credibility does your scheme have if it is &#x27;just a kickstarter project&#x27; rather than something that the important stakeholders have committed to?<p>I have read other comments on this thread and the dupe and I don&#x27;t hear anyone saying this is just what the world needs. Sure my comments are unvarnished but I am trying to share with you my better ideas gained from practical experience dealing with the problem in hand.<p>The Bike Index name is not doing it for me. Have you seen just how good (or bad) the UK bikeregister.com site is?<p><a href=""https://www.bikeregister.com/stolen-bikes"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bikeregister.com&#x2F;stolen-bikes</a><p>I can look at what has recently been stolen in my area. The top navigation is clear and it Google paid-search-results to the top of stolen bikes. The police have their logo on it. There is a lot I would want to change about the site but it is getting there without any off-putting web design. It has a team keen on what they do with IT support, some sales potential for security products and it looks like they are going to stay around for a while. It works to the extent that it does without a lot of support from shops but with a lot of support from the Police. They have stakeholders. In the UK you would have to be a fool to go up against them or provide a new angle with some other service that is the same but more open-source-designed-on-a-mac-with-web-2.0-stuff. It has to be one place people go, not one of many (for a given country).
The people behind bikeregister.com sell marker products. These are the slowest sellers ever in a bike shop, even worse selling than those face masks or arcane BMX trinkets (BMXers have to get mum to pay, don&#x27;t they...). So they haven&#x27;t got the right &#x27;in&#x27; at the retail level. However, I have seen their leaflets around - in shops - so they have tried what you have been trying. Maybe you should talk to them rather than go off thinking you knows bestest...<p>People wanting to show off their bikes already have forums for that, forums that have online community whom you would want to share things with. I know a small amount of people that do such things because they have an angle - retro, weight or niche brand being the &#x27;why&#x27;. Those into the sport have a passing interest in the kit, it is results that matter to them, hence showing off their latest steed is not their gig, if it is then &#x27;weight weenies&#x27; forum it is. Sure &#x27;weight weenies&#x27; (popular over here) may be some dated bulletin board thing but it works and you aren&#x27;t USP enough to that crowd for them to shift over to &#x27;bike index&#x27;. So this showing off one&#x27;s bike thing is doomed, it dilutes the main purpose.<p>Sorry to be harshly negative, but you did post on here to get advice and sometimes people aren&#x27;t honest when they say &#x27;yeah babes fab!&#x27;. I hope for your sake that you don&#x27;t take $50K of people&#x27;s hard earned cash for this - you need a better plan and to come back later when you have got it. Don&#x27;t stop the coding, the testing, the user experience testing and what you are doing in the bike shop already. Go bigger, just pick up the phone and talk to some other people who can help you - the UK bikeregister people could help you with ideas. Get involved at the industry level - go to a big trade show and speak to the top bods, bash their heads together and get an industry solution.

2013-09-30 09:55:23,"1) Inspiration followed by Realisation followed by Ambition.  I started messing around in Microsoft Frontpage age 11 (2000ish). I was shown how to make a simple VB6 program by my father (2002). Here I came to understand logic and how GUI&#x27;s make stuff happen on computers. I wrote trolling&#x2F;phishing tools for AOL for about a year making use of more complicated hooks written by other people (2003). I then turned back to the web with PHP, since it was a more accessible way to get my things into the hands of people (2004). I played computer games back when you could mod them - I wrote scripts, made 3d models and textures. This is where ambition set in. My first PHP real project when I thought I&#x27;d learnt what I was doing was a messaging app with login &#x2F; registration (2005). I found MySQL doing this. I had a MySQL book which I referred to but it was the only book I really used to learn. My peers found security holes in my app, the login had a redirect which included the user id in a get argument, which you could simply change (true story). This taught me the importance of considering how people will attack my code. <i>This was a critical factor in helping me learn to code</i> When you consider from another perspective, you more deeply understand what it is you&#x27;re doing. I continued with PHP and MySQL and the front end stack, I kept pushing myself, starting ambitious projects (hell, I can build Facebook) that ultimately I&#x27;d never finished. I got bored quickly, I was always doing something new. Back to PHP, Zend Framework (my first framework) provided another giant leap in my understanding (2006). I delved into it, I realised how much I can learn from others. I learnt the benefit of going into the code and understanding it. I learnt design patterns, I learnt what good software looked like, I began to write software, rather than &#x27;web pages&#x27;. I dropped out of college and got my first job as a web developer writing PHP websites and doing sys admin for hundreds of clients, alone (2007, age 18). I started to get good at what I did professionally. I began looking harder at other languages, but only a little. I wouldn&#x27;t start projects with new languages, just appreciate them from afar. Ruby, Python, Go, C#, Java. I realised that databases, other software, tools, services and api&#x27;s are all just components or tools, nothing to fear and held new and potentially better ideas than I had at the moment. MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, zeromq, RabbitMQ, memcache. I carried on focussing on few languages but becoming far more capable and adaptable for the next 4&#x2F;5 years. In 2011 I started to become interested in JavaScript and doing that properly, because it&#x27;d always been taken for granted with jQuery being such a great API. 
2013 I&#x27;m writing browser-based apps and apis. You can ask me to do anything and I&#x27;ll probably be pretty good.<p>Slacker at school, College drop out, in full time employment since the age of 18. Now a multi-skilled contractor at 25. I&#x27;m not really a programmer but more of a problem solver. Programming is one of the secondary tools I use, my brain is my primary tool. You don&#x27;t need formal training to achieve it.<p>Timeline:<p><pre><code>  1988: Born

2013-09-14 15:08:48,"Yes, I agree with you that the way we manage our contact date is outdated.<p>The problems nowadays are:<p>1) If you include pseudonyms and literally all user data, you will earn the distrust of millions of users that don&#x27;t want this data centralized in the databases of one company. 
(I know it is possible to figure out almost all the interconnections e.g. via IP, Cookies, Location data, your browsing history. But still they are given implicit. Handing all your user data to one company firsthand plays in a totally different league.)<p>2) This system, especially the automatic updates via sent out API calls, requires deep integration in countless pieces of software. Windows, Mac, Linux and all their ways of managing contacts, the corresponding mobile systems need to adapt and what about the business sector?
You could counter that it is a standalone app and the user has the choice on every platform. And that would be the next problem. All the existing services (about.me, dooid.me, even the Gravatar, or even providing a downloadable or scannable .vcard file or QR-code on a self-hosted webpage) are not used by any majority of people. Why?  The majority simply does not submerge that deeply into the technology. 
Yet another service that bring yet more responsibilities (setting up privacy boundaries etc.) might be appealing to the techy-nerdy kind, but not at all to &quot;Joe Average&quot;.<p>3) What this would need is huge company&#x27;s backup. And to be honest, Google has had the chance...but they screwed it up. Google+. The idea behind the circles is great (hence the resemblance to your &quot;spheres&quot;?). But tying it to yet another social network and forcing it upon it&#x27;s users is not the way to build a user base that trusts and accepts the platform.
I don&#x27;t believe any piece of statistic released talking of 400 Million registered users (of course, because they force it upon the Google Play and YouTube users) or the 100 Million active users (of course, YouTube commenters, still want to comment). If I check my Google+ Stream it is dead to 95% of my contacts. There is less going on than on facebook. (Which we all apparently distrust and has seriously lost the contact management game.)<p>All this leads me to the conclusion that the introduction of an important functionality like the one you describes can&#x27;t be done by any kind of service.<p>It should become a &quot;protocol&quot;. Maybe a vcard-protocol. And in the best case a P2P based one that is encrypted. Why?
- My user data doesn&#x27;t change every second, so there is absolutely no need for 99,99% availability.
- Our smartphones are online almost 24&#x2F;7 anyways. And in addition our various other internet access devices even increase that number ;)
- Ot the information could be circled around in the P2P-network, highly encrypted. As the data size of maybe a profile picture and a bunch of contact details is not really an issue, this actually would be feasible.
- It could be combined with PGP, maybe even use the very same keys. Which could and should increase the number of users encrypting their conversations.
- The information would not leave the users hands unencrypted. 
- The possibilities are defined by the protocol and the user has to set up allowances (sphere permissions) accordingly on the platform he uses.
- As you now can setup various IMAP mail accounts you could create various vcard-information snippets for all the various identities you want to manage.
- A unique ID of course is necessary, this could be used for the NFC&#x2F;BT or just motion-sensor&#x2F;timestamp&#x2F;location based (&quot;bumping&quot;) handshake to exchange the information. The encrypted vcard-information package can of course be published directly or in form of a link&#x2F;QR-code via NFC&#x2F;BT&#x2F;local Wifi.
- It should not be file based to the user.
- The encryption (I don&#x27;t know if PGP allows this) should be able to terminate itself if the user didn&#x27;t refresh the permission or didn&#x27;t prolong the availability.<p>The big problem is...how can a protocol like this be made attractive to be used.
One would need a group of manufacturers&#x2F;companies, like Google with Android and it&#x27;s web-based contact database and Apple with iOS and it&#x27;s horrible contacts App.<p>The problem is...there is too much money in user-data...

(&quot;He&#x27;s my partner.  He&#x27;d never abandon the business.  We&#x27;re in this together.&quot;)<p>* You rely solely on Facebook &#x2F; Twitter &#x2F; Apple App Store and are at the mercy of their changes in policy (&quot;Oh Facebook would never just shut us down.&quot;)<p>* You&#x27;re built solely on the Foursquare Places API. (&quot;Foursquare won&#x27;t just kill all the companies that rely on their API...right?&quot;)<p>Etc. etc. etc.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t saying that you should be paralyzed by the potential for SPoFs to hurt your business -- it may make sense to proceed even with them around (i.e. lots of people have made a lot of money building FB apps).<p>But you MUST be aware of what they are, and you MUST have a plan in place to handle the continuation of the business if one of them comes true.",Facebook,one import lesson #x27 learn growing-up phase entrepreneur one first thing #x27 next startup put togeth list quot ;d oomsday scenario quot right bat <p> _single_ action #x2f event #x2f scenario could kill busi overnight <p> emphas singl everi busi go potenti seri unforeseen event kill e microsoft would probabl seen #x27 appl releas phone #x27 busi #x2f balmer-kil everi busi keenli awar single-points-of-failur spof <p> seem obviou mani folk either will ignor choos pretend spof #x27 exist ration scenario away <p> exampl <p> run aw singl avail zone avail zone goe week quot cloud super reliabl amazon #x27 go quot ;) <p> cto person compani know product quit overnight #x2f get injur #x2f becom incapacit quot #x27 partner #x27 ;d never abandon busi #x27 togeth quot ;) <p> reli sole facebook #x2f twitter #x2f appl app store merci chang polici quot ;O h facebook would never shut us quot ;) <p> #x27 built sole foursquar place api quot foursquar #x27 kill compani reli api right quot ;) <p> etc etc etc <p> #x27 say paralyz potenti spof hurt busi may make sens proceed even around e lot peopl made lot money build fb app <p> must awar must plan place handl continu busi one come true,0.18095238095238095,0.5382653061224489

2013-08-07 11:56:43,"That&#x27;s how the iOS core location API works (and it has been this way since iOS 5 atleast, if not earlier).<p>In particular, there is a |startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges| method (<a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/CLLocationManager/CLLocationManager.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/CLLocationManager/startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;ios&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;CoreLo...</a>), which &quot;callbacks&quot; into apps that have registered with the Core Location framework for significant change updates.

2013-07-24 09:03:57,"My experience with building an alternative Android Facebook client (which naturally uses almost every part of the API):<p>1) Just keeping up with documented and undocumented breaking changes is probably a full time job.<p>2) Expect that some feature of the API breaks every 2 weeks, especially login on their Android SDKs cannot be relied upon.(reliable for me is the industry standard for server uptime usually advertised - 99.99999%) If your application just uses few parts of the API it probably once every 1 or 2 months.<p>3) Substract 0.5 to 1.0 points from the rating of your app in the Android or iOS app store, depending on how heavy you rely on Facebook, because of the instability of their APIs.<p>4) Expect to spend at least a day per month writing bug reports.

2013-07-24 04:05:01,"A very well-written and judicious obituary of Facebook Platform. I started building for it shortly after it launched, in late 2007. I had high hopes for it; I felt I was at the forefront of &#x27;the next big thing,&#x27; like others, so I invested a lot of my time into it. I made apps that served millions of people, one of which reached #1 in DAU at one point among all apps (back when they ranked apps by DAU).<p>As a lone developer keeping up with the changes and additions wasn&#x27;t easy - I literally ran the gamut - from FBML to FBJS to FQL to xd_receiver.htm to the JS SDK to FB Credits to Graph API. Initially I cut them some slack - it was a new platform, and we all make mistakes.<p>But things never really got better. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how many times I came across 4, 5, 6 different ways to do the same (seemingly simple) interaction with the platform, only one of which worked, and of course not the officially documented method. Or inaccurate or nonexistent API docs. Or how many times my app would suddenly break without pushing any changes - I became accustomed to just waiting it out until Facebook would release a patch for whatever they broke, and have to tell my users to just wait it out. This would usually occur Tuesday night&#x2F;Wednesday if I remember correctly.<p>Solutions to problems would usually lie in an obscure forum post after about 10 minutes of googling, posted by another friendly developer who probably tore his hair out looking for a solution. Ah, the camaraderie. Here&#x27;s a recent one I just came across (and they&#x27;re not hard to find) <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16649634/ios-url-scheme-fb-event-llu-no-longer-working-in-6-1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;16649634&#x2F;ios-url-scheme-f...</a>\nAccepted answers that start with &quot;Facebook seems to have...&quot; and end with &quot;change or remove them completely at will&quot; tend to give developers more than a few gray hairs.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that Facebook tends to treat developers like sheep. At first this didn&#x27;t bother me - after all, they weren&#x27;t forcing me to build apps for them, and I was free to leave at any time. In the early days I&#x27;d contact developer support (I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a published number) to report bugs&#x2F;issues, suggest improvements, or genuinely ask for help with a problem. I never got a single non-automated response. Not once. So I stopped wasting my time and just became more and more bitter with every breaking change.<p>The 30% credits tax was the inflection point of the downfall. IMHO, that was a &quot;me too&quot; response to Apple&#x27;s iOS platform (coincidence that they came up with the same fee structure?) and was, for me, the tell-tale sign that they were no longer interested in their developers&#x27; well being. Yes, I understand they need to make money. I am all for ringing the cash register. But Apple and Facebook are different platforms. Apple has a highly trafficked worldwide app store. They let me put my app icon on my users&#x27; home screens (that&#x27;s valuable real estate), and I could push out unlimited notifications to my users&#x27; devices to keep them engaged and coming back with one click, among other things. Facebook has no such equivalents. I guess you could argue you&#x27;re paying for the viral distribution, but after they&#x27;ve heavily curtailed their viral channels and people have become more and more immune to app invites, there&#x27;s really no way to get free distribution anymore from Facebook. You still need to be buying ads, mostly from them.<p>If they wanted to make money and curtail spam, all they had to do was charge developers by each notification, invite, or newsfeed post they&#x27;d send out. Set a fixed price per message, or use a competitive auctioning system like adwords. The crapplications would never be able to afford their own spam.<p>I&#x27;ve since migrated my apps away from Facebook, either to mobile or on standalone web sites. Needless to say, my life as a developer has gotten a lot easier, and since I have more time to focus on improving my apps rather than keeping up with breaking changes, I&#x27;m doing better than I ever have before.",Facebook,"well-written judici obituari facebook platform start build shortli launch late 2007 high hope felt forefront #x27 next big thing #x27 like other invest lot time made app serv million peopl one reach 1 dau one point among app back rank app dau <p> lone develop keep chang addit #x27 easi liter ran gamut fbml fbj fql xd_receiv htm js sdk fb credit graph api initi cut slack new platform make mistak <p> thing never realli got better #x27 tell mani time came across 4, 5, 6 differ way seemingli simpl interact platform one work cours offici document method inaccur nonexist api doc mani time app would suddenli break without push chang becam accustom wait facebook would releas patch whatev broke tell user wait would usual occur tuesday night #x2f wednesday rememb correctli <p> solut problem would usual lie obscur forum post 10 minut googl post anoth friendli develop probabl tore hair look solut ah camaraderi #x27 recent one came across #x27 hard find <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16649634/ios-url-scheme-fb-event-llu-no-longer-working-in-6-1-1"" rel=""nofollow""> http #x2f #x2f stackoverflow com #x2f question #x2f 16649634 #x2f ios-url-scheme-f </a> naccept answer start quot facebook seem quot end quot chang remov complet quot tend give develop gray hair <p> also #x27 help facebook tend treat develop like sheep first #x27 bother #x27 forc build app free leav time earli day #x27 ;d contact develop support #x27 think #x27 publish number report bug #x2f issu suggest improv genuin ask help problem never got singl non-autom respons stop wast time becam bitter everi break chang <p> 30 credit tax inflect point downfal imho quot quot respons appl #x27 io platform coincid came fee structur tell-tal sign longer interest develop #x27 well ye understand need make money ring cash regist appl facebook differ platform appl highli traffick worldwid app store let put app icon user #x27 home screen #x27 valuabl real estat could push unlimit notif user #x27 devic keep engag come back one click among thing facebook equival guess could argu #x27 pay viral distribut #x27 heavili curtail viral channel peopl becom immun app invit #x27 realli way get free distribut anymor facebook still need buy ad mostli <p> want make money curtail spam charg develop notif invit newsfe post #x27 ;d send set fix price per messag use competit auction system like adword crapplic would never abl afford spam <p> #x27 sinc migrat app away facebook either mobil standalon web site needless say life develop gotten lot easier sinc time focu improv app rather keep break chang #x27 better ever",-0.003347763347763338,0.4283116883116883

2013-06-20 13:39:49,"The PHP team does take speed seriously and just about every minor release gets a little bit faster, sometimes alot, like 20% faster. I&#x27;m not even including stuff like the opcode caches that are built in now like APC or Zend Optimizer+. Lots of times, minor releases also get more efficient with memory usage too. If you are not happy with the speed, PHP is an open source project and you can contribute patches to speed it up.<p>Documentation gets fixed all the time. PHP has been historically known as having one of the best docs and the docs have contributed to its success. As with the source code, the docs are open to contributions if you feel the need to modify or add something.<p>That&#x27;s funny you say PHP can&#x27;t scale. Facebook, Yahoo, Etsy and a whole lot of other big PHP shops get more traffic than most of us will ever see in a few life times. So, PHP scales. Even pre-Hiphop Facebook got more traffic than most of us will will ever see. Many times scaling is more about architecture design&#x2F;implementation than language. App Engine is all about scaling and PHP runs on it. Oh by the way, at scale, every language is a data center toaster oven.<p>PHP people aren&#x27;t mad that people are leaving. They are happy that it is still the #1 language used for web development.<p>The only valid argument you have is the mixed methods and stuff. It would be cool to fix, but it would mean seriously breaking the API and would cause a lot of confusion. Every minor release breaks the API a little bit and people are unhappy. So, this might never change. I don&#x27;t see it as a big deal because if you are a great programmer, you know the quirks of your language and they don&#x27;t throw you off. Also, there is auto-completion and docs for you to look up things if you don&#x27;t know stuff off the top of your head.<p>It is true that lots of developers have left PHP, but it is a falsehood that everybody is moving away from PHP. If that was the case, PHP wouldn&#x27;t be running on 75% of the public facing web hosts out there. There would be a business incentive (because they are using another language) to get PHP off their box. They could devote those resources to the new language they are using. The 75% number shows that their is no mass exodus, but definitely evidence not everybody is using PHP.<p>Oh, by the way, PHP is open source so you can help contribute to its continued success if you like.

There are two simple reasons for this: usage of Google Plus^W^WSearch has declined, and as a company were pouring all of our energy into fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better  and more sociable  user experience.<p>Its been a long time since weve had this rate of change  it probably hasnt happened since the birth of social media in July 2011, with our superior social media platform, Google Plus. So today were officially folding a number of other products into Google Plus:<p>* YouTube will become Google Plus Video. Your YouTube will be just the same, youll just need a username you have government ID for. Dont worry  you can trust us with it.<p>* Google Maps API will become Google Plus Maps. Youll need to add your house, your workplace, your favourite retail experiences and your credit card number to your circles, then you can look up any place you want. You can opt out to Apple Maps any time you like.<p>* Google Docs got absorbed by Google Drive, which will become Google SUM(). Imagine the social of your spreadsheets being rated by all your friends! Once again, users who opt out are free to revel in the joys of Office 365.<p>* Google Voice App for BlackBerry will be discontinued once weve found both remaining BlackBerry users and notified them.<p>* Orkut, of course, is being kept.<p>We know youll be delighted with the Google Plus experience, with hundreds of millions of people every month delighted to be using Google Plus! Or products that require a profile on it. Its like Facebook without all the annoying people on it. Or any people. But the people on it love it with huge enthusiasm, just like the ones who loved Google Buzz before we shot that through the head too. Come onto Plus, or Vic will cry. You dont want to see Vic crying, do you? Asshole. You probably hurt puppies, too.<p>To ensure a smooth transition, were providing a three-month sunset period so you have sufficient time to find an alternate web-searching solution.

2013-03-22 10:06:14,"""Sorry"", but you just moved the centralized identity to a different location, you aren't magically removing it: in fact, you <i>can't</i> magically remove it, because there is no such thing as a universal canonical form of identity. If there was, we would just use that instead of all of these more complex forms of identity we build up.<p>In the case of the e-mail address, you are moving it to the person providing the domain name the e-mail address is on; this is thereby explicitly why I brought up OpenID--which you seem to have totally ignored--as it is also a distributed system but yet it doesn't <i>force</i> the incorrect assumption that Persona does (specifically, that e-mail addresses are canonical identification mechanisms for users, and so nigh-unto encourages opaque tokens to be returned).<p>Let's put this another way: you seem to believe that there is a way to assign a token to a user in a way that works for them no matter where they are. I believe that that entire concept is a fantasy. In particular, I believe the one that Persona chose, which you seem to want to defend, only works for a very weird subset of users that are technical enough to understand that others make this incorrect assumption, and then organize their lives around it.<p>In comparison, once you assume that there is no such identifier, you start asking how you federate the choice, and you end up with the idea of ""identity providers"". However, you now have no stable way of holding on to identity as you change providers. I maintain that is an unsolvable problem, and it should be treated as an unsolvable problem: the concept of an identifier that can cross multiple identity providers is, again, a fantasy.<p>So the result is that you now have to ask the question of what identifier is used within an identity provider. I maintain that e-mail addresses are a horrible horrible choice, as they are known to be something that the people who provide them are known to reuse, and they are things many users want to be able to change often. Instead, it should be encouraged to make the token entirely opaque, with a requirement in the spec that ""this token will never get reused by any other user using your identification provider ever in the future"". AFAIK, OpenID states exactly this.<p>And yet, when I go to log in to a website using OpenID, I can select Google as my authentication provider, and then log in with my e-mail address. Later, when my e-mail address changes, I'll be able to log in with a different e-mail address, and Google will assign me the same OpenID identifier for my federated login with other websites. You end up in a similar boat if you use the various OAuth flows that other companies use, such as with Facebook, then using an API to get the stable identifier (which for Facebook is a number).<p>Look: I maintain a website with tens of millions of worldwide users, and I <i>only</i> have federated login. I deal with the issues of federated login day in and day out. I deal with users from very diverse user communities, and I see how they treat their e-mail addresses (as sadly, Google will not let you change your Gmail address without getting a new account, so a lot of users are forced into situations where their identification changes when there was no real reason why it should have been required).

2013-03-21 19:28:07,"(Apologies for the big rant, these are some ideas that have been rattling about in my head recently and your post made some things clearer in my mind. It's not meant to be a post of factual 'truths', but an explanation for my (and perhaps others) reaction against the web as the one platform to rule them all. So it's as much an emotional gut reaction as a logical one. )<p>I think this (desire for ubiquity/multi-platform) is the main reason I don't see eye-to-eye with the people who are pushing for web apps for everything. Web apps everywhere is great for large corporations that want to provide their service on as many platforms as possible. It's great for venture capital funded startups where the name of the game is to get as many users as possible and get bought out before your money runs out.<p>I'm a small indie dev though, I produce software (not software as a front end to a non-software business), and I'm not looking to become a billionaire (really!). I want to develop software because I enjoy it: to solve problems for real people, to solve my own problems. So really I don't care too much about being able to target every platform at once. I want to target the platforms I like, using the tools that I like, and as long as the platform has enough users to make it viable then I can do that with native software on open platforms (the latter is important and why I don't write iOS software, for example). There is the risk that the platform I target gets killed, but if a lot of people use it then that's generally going to be a slow process, and there is plenty of churn in web tech and standards anyway so it's not like it provides immunity to technological change. Additionally, I just have a hard time working with web technologies. I find them much harder to use, to the extent that if using html/css was the only way to write software I wouldn't be writing software at all and I'd go stack shelves in the supermarket instead. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to use them effectively, I don't know.<p>I guess this is partly the old 'software as craft'/'lifestyle business' argument, but it saddens me slightly that the big industry players are moving us away from the kind of industry where you can write software that interacts with some arbitrary bit of hardware in unsupported or unintended ways towards a much more controlled and profit orientated one (i.e. your software running everywhere being the most important criterion of all). Web people are not the only offenders here of course, but arguments against things like iOS have been well explored over the years.<p>Some people seem to view the web as some kind of beacon of freedom, the little guy fighting the big bad industry giants of Microsoft, Apple, Adobe and so on. But from where I am, the web <i>is</i> the big bad industry giants. Writing web software means being restricted to a very limited sandbox. The APIs available to me are decided by what a small cabal of powerful companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Nokia and maybe a few others) can agree on. None of their interests align with mine (why would they?).<p>If Gopher had taken off and supplanted native development to the extent that people were using platforms that could only run Gopher apps, would the current web even exist? All user facing software being written to a single standard and API has good things about it, but it also limits new ideas tremendously (""sure you can add X feature you just need to get it through this committee of industry heavyweights first and get them all to agree, and then wait for them to ship it"").<p>What is important to me is that data uses open standards, whether at rest or in motion. If people control their data, and it is in open formats, then there is little companies can do to lock them in. Which is good for me as a dev since I can write software to help users work with that data. Web technologies don't do much to help me there, in-fact for the most part they have made it easier for companies to keep users data locked away on their server in unknown formats or behind proprietary APIs that I don't feel confident building software against. More concisely: email good, Facebook bad; FLAC good, Spotify bad.<p>I'm not arguing against all web sites/apps (or any hypothetical tech stack that offers a similar standard sandboxed environment). For some things it can be appropriate: wikipedia or hacker news or other inherently networked activities for example.  I'd prefer something less byzantine of course, but I expect that if the web apps model does take off then ways of targeting it that mean you don't have to think about CSS or Javascript will get more traction, in the same way that I can write native code without having to worry about assembly (most of the time). Javascript as a compilation target will become ""fast enough"" on most hardware for general purpose things (not for absolutely everything, but that is just another manifestation of the problem of not being able to break outside the sandbox when needed). So the technical issues of css/javascript being horrible are not the main problem.<p>I come from a social science background, which perhaps taints my view here. I look for the power dynamics that limit my real world ability to do things, and don't really care so much about theoretical ideas about a perfect world where everybody works together in harmony to make the web a platform that does everything you could ever need in a timely way.

This is all about to change. Why? Because in the next decade these technologies, operating systems and hardware devices that are currently being built by the aforementioned brands, will be so similar to each other, the consumer will care less about the actual design of the hardware or its brand. People will just demand a pane of glass, more or less. Glass will just be glass. The wow factor will wear off after awhile.</i><p>Having developed quite a few apps and websites I find myself agreeing with this thesis - the web will win in the end, not because of any inherent technical advantage (in some ways it's behind mobile apps in terms of performance, look and feel etc), but because the open web has so many advantages for developers and users that in the end it will overcome its disadvantages, and it is of course improving all the time as browsers improve, so the performance gap is narrowing constantly. At some point the performance won't matter, and the advantages of the open web will come to the fore.<p>The contrast between deploying a few fixes a day to a website, and churning out new app versions only to have them rejected by someone at Apple, often for inscrutable and unjustified reasons, then waiting days or weeks for approval, could not be more marked.<p>And as a user, the advantages of the open web (i.e. not walled gardens like Facebook) will I think have an irresistible pull - advantages like linkable, shareable content, content on any device even unforeseen ones, not having to rebuy apps but just subscribing once and using anywhere. The fact that web dev imposes so many limitations is actually a strength, as it means it can be deployed almost anywhere, and give at least some value to users for decades and over any new devices which come out, as opposed to the binaries being created for current mobile platforms, which in a decade will be forgotten.<p>I almost wish Apple had stuck with their first solution of asking developers to use a webkit API on iOS. It would be fascinating to know just exactly how surprised Apple were by the reaction to their suggestion that app developers develop using webkit, and whether they always planned to have a native SDK.

2013-02-08 00:34:25,"iCloud in general ""just works"". It was pretty terrible from the get-go, from reliability to really egregious bugs in the OS, but at this point is pretty stable.<p>The real problem here is the combination of iCloud and Core Data (for non-Apple folks, the built-in persistence/object model framework).<p>In a somewhat simplified way, Core Data is a data store most commonly backed by SQLite. It's used everywhere from your mail app to the Facebook app. It's handy and convenient when it isn't trying to kill you - it's one of the more complex frameworks that Apple ships, and the documentation is <i>extremely</i> poor for it. It also doesn't help that there is a <i>lot</i> of quirky behavior that's more or less tribal knowledge to long-time Apple devs and WWDC attendees, and is has enough concurrency gotchas to fill a container ship.<p>So, Core Data is not the simplest piece of code to work with from the get-go, and then you pile iCloud on top.<p>iCloud is conceptually pretty simple - there's a directory on your file system that is replicated to Apple's servers, and back down to each one of your devices. When files change the OS sends notifications to your app informing you of such. If you're using iCloud as a distributed file system (a la Dropbox), it's easy to integrate.<p>The trouble with this model is that Core Data stores can be in fact quite large. If you have a 30MB database of, say, recipes on your disk, you really don't want to resend the whole thing every time your user alters a row. Apple special-cases Core Data stores in iCloud by sending only deltas, but the implementation is utterly broken:<p>- There is no baseline state(s). The database is literally the playback of every delta, with no canonical snapshots. Ever.<p>- iCloud is really bad at sequencing the deltas, especially if (somewhat) concurrent changes are happening. Core Data is also <i>terrifyingly bad</i> at conflict resolution when deltas from different devices don't line up.<p>- The above points means that it's <i>trivially easy</i> to break your entire database, as your deltas no longer play back to a sane database file. When this occurs there is no way to roll back your database, since there is no concept of a snapshot or last known good state.<p>- This is compounded by some really horrible API design on Apple's part. When your iCloud database becomes corrupt <i>it fails silently</i>, with absolutely <i>no</i> API that allows one to determine said broken state. Your app literally stops working with none of the OS making a single peep, and no way for you to proactively check your database's state. iCloud seems to print some debug things into your console indicating this failure, but neither your app nor your users have access to it. This manifests in your app (and in tech support requests) as ""iCloud just stopped syncing"" - your device stops transmitting deltas and simply works off of the last locally-cached good state, all without telling the dev or the user.<p>- This is further compounded by the fact that the entirety of Core Data+iCloud was rushed out the door. Documentation was non-existent even up to the day the new version of iOS went out to the public. There was literally only one source of information: a thread on the Apple dev forums that Apple engineers would sometimes pop into.<p>- This is further compounded by the fact that even the Apple engineers themselves seemed to have no idea how to implement an app with iCloud + Core Data. The example code (provided deep, deep within aforementioned thread) made 90 degree turns seemingly every few days. The same sample would have <i>dramatically</i> changing implementations from week to week. The Apple engineers in the thread seemed as mystified as the people trying to use the framework.<p>- The poor documentation and poor state of sample code, as well as what is IMO a fundamentally broken architecture means that iCloud + Core Data remains a complete nightmare to this day. I think the poor architecture is really the core of this here - while Apple could have provided better docs and better support, I believe the fundamental architecture choices made here means Core Data + iCloud would never have been workable.<p>- The icing on top of the cake was an extremely egregious bug that existed at launch (unsure now, you couldn't pay me enough money to work with that API ever again). ""Okay, so our deltas are completely fucked"" you say, ""Why don't we just delete the app's entire iCloud bucket and start over?""<p>A jolly good idea until you realize that a bug in iOS/iCloud means that <i>when you delete an app's iCloud storage ""bin"", it cannot be recreated by that app, ever again</i>.",Facebook,icloud gener work pretti terribl get-go reliabl realli egregi bug os point pretti stabl <p> real problem combin icloud core data non-appl folk built-in persist object model framework <p> somewhat simplifi way core data data store commonli back sqlite use everywher mail app facebook app handi conveni tri kill one complex framework appl ship document <i> extrem </i> poor also help <i> lot </i> quirki behavior that' less tribal knowledg long-tim appl dev wwdc attende enough concurr gotcha fill contain ship <p> core data simplest piec code work get-go pile icloud top <p> icloud conceptu pretti simpl there' directori file system replic apple' server back one devic file chang os send notif app inform use icloud distribut file system la dropbox easi integr <p> troubl model core data store fact quit larg 30 mb databas say recip disk realli want resend whole thing everi time user alter row appl special-cas core data store icloud send delta implement utterli broken <p> baselin state databas liter playback everi delta canon snapshot ever <p> icloud realli bad sequenc delta especi somewhat concurr chang happen core data also <i> terrifyingli bad </i> conflict resolut delta differ devic line <p> point mean <i> trivial easi </i> break entir databas delta longer play back sane databas file occur way roll back databas sinc concept snapshot last known good state <p> compound realli horribl api design apple' part icloud databas becom corrupt <i> fail silent </i> absolut <i> </i> api allow one determin said broken state app liter stop work none os make singl peep way proactiv check database' state icloud seem print debug thing consol indic failur neither app user access manifest app tech support request icloud stop sync devic stop transmit delta simpli work last locally-cach good state without tell dev user <p> compound fact entireti core data icloud rush door document non-exist even day new version io went public liter one sourc inform thread appl dev forum appl engin would sometim pop <p> compound fact even appl engin seem idea implement app icloud core data exampl code provid deep deep within aforement thread made 90 degre turn seemingli everi day sampl would <i> dramat </i> chang implement week week appl engin thread seem mystifi peopl tri use framework <p> poor document poor state sampl code well imo fundament broken architectur mean icloud core data remain complet nightmar day think poor architectur realli core appl could provid better doc better support believ fundament architectur choic made mean core data icloud would never workabl <p> ice top cake extrem egregi bug exist launch unsur pay enough money work api ever okay delta complet fuck say delet app' entir icloud bucket start <p> jolli good idea realiz bug io icloud mean <i> delet app' icloud storag bin cannot recreat app ever </i>,-0.0531781226903178,0.4293791574279379

2013-01-31 16:18:28,"Research scientists will soon encounter similar pressures to entrepreneurs who negotiate the Medicare system. The scenario outlined in the article is similar to many of the prosecutions for ""Medicare fraud"".<p>Briefly, Medicare fraud is alleged whenever a business charges a lot to Medicare. This could be due to rapid growth or due to actual fraud, but it's immaterial. And often rapid growth happens due to exploitation of a previously unseen gray area (e.g. Facebook News Feed for Zynga) so regulators usually have an excuse to allege fraud. Unlike FB, they don't just block your API calls; the consequence of a new name appearing at the top of a ""biggest earner list"" is often a meteoric descent from a fast growing business into a federal prosecution.<p>NIH is much nicer than other HHS agencies, as its primary duty is to hand out money rather than enforce regulations. But what happened here is similar. Someone ran analytics to try and figure out which scientists were getting the most money from NIH, and to put some blocks on that in a time of scarce funds. In this case, the issue is that scientists naturally want to avoid duplication of work, and some projects require more funding than the limits of one grant. So they package up the same papers for different agencies with a different spin (bio-terrorism for DoD and bio-remediation for DoE). That's natural and good: leverage your existing work to get more money for the same amount of input. Put another way, this is like selling the same product (your research output) in multiple distribution channels.<p>However, problems arise with third party payment. I don't mind that you got a ""duplicate"" can of Coca Cola, or that the Coke company amortized labor across two different cans. But the government is ostensibly paying on behalf of the public for this work, and its incentives are more to keep scientists employed and to appear egalitarian than to maximize scientific productivity <i>per se</i>. It also wants to award less in grants while seeming ""fair"".<p>In any case, while nothing criminal/civil is being alleged now, I anticipate that grant agencies will make use of software that checks for duplicates in a way to reduce the outflow of money and make it harder for scientists to leverage the same work in multiple channels. The only silver lining here is that some scientists may start to explore non-governmental channels for funding, like patrons in the technology sector, or Kickstarters, or MOOCs, or other vehicles. Another response will be predator/prey like evasions by scientists, to set up grant collaboratives of K people in which the senior author is changed for each application.

Right now, people dont seem to care about privacy all that much, and I can't blame them.
Every time the privacy debate comes up in relation to google or facebook the conversation is steered towards the following assumptions:<p><pre><code>  - The attacker is another member of the website or an anonymous web user.
  - The platform (gmail or facebook) is a trusted third party.
</code></pre>
This is not the debate I want to be having. I don't agree with the second assumption. Any privacy policy I can fill out for my data will not prevent the company from accessing my data. They own the database and the file servers and even have authority over my login credentials for that website.<p>What about the privacy in the following paradigm:<p><pre><code>   - The attacker can be any person or company on the internet.
   - Your server is a VM in a distributed platform of hosts.
   - You have a special credential (id-rsa), which is used to change settings on the VM.  
   - Host can be trusted most of the time, but sometimes (prob=0.2) they are malicious.

</code></pre>
If we ensure there is a big ecosystem of hosting companies with a compatible API, then individual users could constantly migrate their hosting plans and change companies every month, or even every week. Thus in the worst case, a ""cloud host"" could eavesdrop on you just for one week. If you constantly change hosts, you will get a guaranteed 80% privacy, which is much better than 0% privacy.<p>Anyone who has lots of servers on their hands and wants to start a hosting company -- I say you get the whole ""my home in the cloud"" app hosting business started:

A few things changed my mind.<p>The first was the realization that Adobe wasn't going to make any more cool fun stuff for me. I feel like they've just lost their way with all that and now that I look back on it, it seems like Macromedia actually made all the aspects of Flash that I enjoy. The most recent thing Adobe has done for me is Stage3D but even that is so technical that they're relying on 3rd parties like Away3D to build the friendly API on top of it.<p>The second was doing a project that was as close to an art piece as I've ever come doing ad agency work that was entirely in HTML/CSS3 and JS.

What I found while I was doing that project was that the web has changed a lot while I've been doing Flash and I didn't realize how much annoying obtuse boilerplate I had to write in AS3 that just becomes total cake when you're using HTML for markup, CSS for style and JS for slick transitions and communication. My main love affair is with HTML and JS, I still think CSS is...CSS. With HTML I'm getting all the great structural stuff that Flex devs love, without the mind numblingly elaborate class structures they have to deal with. With good JS libraries like jQuery I'm getting the cross browser DOM support that I need because I just don't have those sea legs yet. And when you combine it all you can work really, really fast. I spent the whole first half of that project cursing JavaScript up and down the office. I would make little examples showing how setInterval loses scope and demo it for my team and be like ""look! this stuff is retarded! I want AS3 back!"" Then one day I had to build this twitter widget, and I sat down and I just cranked it out in no time. And I thought, 'You know, if I had been doing this in Flash I would have spent so much time dealing with URLLoaders and cross policy files and coreLib for JSON parsing...' It just felt like things had gone smoother because I wasn't fighting against the web to make it fit inside my Flash app. And that was about the time that I felt like I got over the hump, and from there it was all downhill.<p>It totally had warts and I got stung by IE transparency bugs but in the end we sorted it all out and now I know how to deal with those issues. And to be honest, they were pretty minimal. The Facebook API was far worse than the cross browser stuff.<p>If you're making the transition then read this: <a href=""http://jqfundamentals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqfundamentals.com/</a>
I read it start to finish and it made things so much easier for me. Then once you're comfortable with jQuery, leave it behind and try the other stuff.

This unique plugin is authorized to request keys for messages for your Trusted Contacts and generate new keys associated with your account.<p>The keys are generated in parallel on the client and on the key management server. They are always rolling forward and are synced with the key management server in real-time utilizing a few unique variables within your custom plugin and a few generated randomly each time.<p>No two messages are encrypted with the same key and keys are only stored in memory during the encryption / decryption process. Every time a message or photo that has been protected is viewed, either by yourself or others, authorization to that messages key is requested from the key management server.<p>Your Trusted Contact list is managed globally by connecting with other users through Social Fortress. Within Facebook all of your friends are initially treated as Trusted Contacts and you can easily remove individuals from this list with the click of a button.<p>Social Fortress uses AES-256 CTR for the encryption and communicates over a 256 SSL stream from your device to the key management server. The data in this stream is also encrypted using aspects of your customized installation.<p>The technology for web services (Facebook, Google+) operates as browser plugin for Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer[1] and independent of any service's API.<p>The technology for Thunderbird and Outlook is a separate plugin which requires installation.<p>We integrate transparently into the products we support so the user experience is exactly the same. No extra clicks, no confusing decisions and nothing extra to learn. We designed Social Fortress to be used by individuals who don't even know what the word encryption is.<p>Within every environment you have the ability to enable / disable Social Fortress protection with the click of a button or using a keyboard shortcut (CTRL+Q). This only disables the encryption functions. The reader is always on so messages and photos protected by your friends appear normal without you having to protect your own. It's like having Flash or PDF Reader once it is installed you don't ever have to do anything again.<p>If your device becomes compromised / lost / whatever you can login to the site and disable all active installations in two clicks and this will not affect previously encrypted messages as we just disable authorization access to your old plugins and have no need to change any previously generated keys.<p>We also support other services but have yet to make them live:<p>Skype Chat<p>Twitter<p>mail.yahoo.com<p>Gmail.com<p>Chatter.com<p>Yammer.com<p>Blackberry Native Email support<p>[1] The IE Plugin is not currently part of the public beta.",Facebook,"link bit technic detail <p> <a href=""https://www.socialfortress.com/"" rel=""nofollow""> https://www.socialfortress.com/</a><p>soci fortress current provid transpar client-sid encrypt decrypt within facebook googl thunderbird outlook messag photo <p> download instal social fortress plugin custom sync account key manag server uniqu plugin author request key messag trust contact gener new key associ account <p> key gener parallel client key manag server alway roll forward sync key manag server real-tim util uniqu variabl within custom plugin gener randomli time <p> two messag encrypt key key store memori encrypt decrypt process everi time messag photo protect view either other author messag key request key manag server <p> trust contact list manag global connect user social fortress within facebook friend initi treat trust contact easili remov individu list click button <p> social fortress use ae 256 ctr encrypt commun 256 ssl stream devic key manag server data stream also encrypt use aspect custom instal <p> technolog web servic facebook googl oper browser plugin firefox chrome internet explor 1 independ service' api <p> technolog thunderbird outlook separ plugin requir instal <p> integr transpar product support user experi exactli extra click confus decis noth extra learn design social fortress use individu even know word encrypt <p> within everi environ abil enabl disabl social fortress protect click button use keyboard shortcut ctrl q disabl encrypt function reader alway messag photo protect friend appear normal without protect like flash pdf reader instal ever anyth <p> devic becom compromis lost whatev login site disabl activ instal two click affect previous encrypt messag disabl author access old plugin need chang previous gener key <p> also support servic yet make live <p> skype chat <p> twitter <p> mail yahoo com <p> gmail com <p> chatter com <p> yammer com <p> blackberri nativ email support <p> 1 ie plugin current part public beta",0.007453567937438905,0.513318670576735

That's starting to change, but a lot of functionality and support is still missing. The phase-out of free promotional credits (for which developers were not paid), which was originally slated to occur on February 15th, is ongoing. A functional reporting and management interface for Credits partners would be very welcome - currently this consists of an incomplete API and two .tsv files (a detailed list and a digest of transactions for the previous day) automatically emailed to publishers nightly. These emails started being sent about six weeks ago. There is currently no mechanism for responding to disputed payments or fraud claims but they say they're working on it.<p>There are positive aspects to Credits though. We see decent adoption but still process many more transactions and many more dollars (at a much lower fee, it's worth reiterating!) through Paypal. The checkout flow is pretty good, and while some people are less trusting of Facebook, some already regard them as a trustworthy steward of CC info, and the latter group is probably more closely aligned with target audiences than the former.<p>I'd say that right now (and at least until off-site, FB Connect implementations of Credits has been in use for months), it's a question of whether your project requires the other benefits of building on Facebook - user data, social hooks, etc - to the extent that it's worth swallowing the fee &#38; quirks of the platform.
