"User and Administrator Java Project","<p>I am creating a Java Project for my exam. The project asks me to do a groupon-like program using Object-oriented programming. 
It asks me to realize a program to sell discounted products. 
I have holidays, dinners and normal objects. I decided to create a super-class Product and then to extend it creating the other three classes, dinners, holidays, and objects. But it also asks me to manage a catalog of the products making have to every product an unique identifier, how can I? Even if I create a Catalog class, managing the product with an ArrayList, how can I add an identifier to each element? I also have to distinguish between users and administrator.Each of them can do different things, the administrator can add and remove products from the catalog, see the active offers and order them, and can see the no longer affordable offers. 
The User can register to the system, buy credits, see the avaible offers, buy something and can see everything that he bought, sorting them by the price or by the date of purchase.</p>

<p>My question is, how can i distinguish the user and allow them to do different things ? I have to allow a log-in operation at the beginning and show different button for users and administrator. Could help me? Give me an idea of how to manage the situation? (Should they be a superclass(user) with an administrator that extends the user?)</p>

"Groupon coupon code system in PHP","<p>I am trying to create a system just like groupon but where merchants input voucher codes into the system that customers can use to get their products.</p>

<p>So let's say Merchant 1 has the following product</p>

<ul>
<li>Product Name: Camera</li>
<li>Product ID: 2</li>
</ul>

<p>He would add coupon codes for Product ID 2 into the system.</p>

<p>Coupons get added to the COUPON table with the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>code</li>
<li>product_id (refers back to Product table</li>
<li>num_available</li>
<li>max</li>
</ul>

<p>max is the maximum of the coupon that can be given out. num_available is the number of that coupon available. So if a Merchant puts in 5 as max, then num_available starts out as 5. but whenever a customer gets assigned that coupon, num_available gets decreased by 1</p>

<p>Then when customers order they get assigned a coupon</p>

<p>User orders get added to the following table Orders:
Orders:</p>

<ul>
<li>order_id</li>
<li>user_id</li>
</ul>

<p>OrderPosition:</p>

<ul>
<li>id </li>
<li>order_id</li>
<li>product_id</li>
<li>amount</li>
<li>coupon_id</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Order (stored in Orders) has multiple products associated with it (stored in OrderPosition). </p>

<p>So User 1 orders Product 2 and gets assigned Coupon ID 1 that was added for Product 2. The num_available for Coupon ID 1 (in the COUPON table) gets decreased by 1 in the database.</p>

<p>but what if User 1 orders TWO Product 2s - one for her and one for her friend - does she get two different coupon codes? </p>

<p>Basically, I would like to make his process more efficient, and I don't know how Groupon has designed this process, but if anyone has good ideas on how best to do so, please let me know! </p>

<p>I would love to know if I should change the database schema to make this more efficient ... </p>

<p>My end goal is to allow people to buy deals. Once they buy a deal, they get a coupon. I could have automatically generated that coupon, but I'm guessing some merchants want to input their own coupons that work on their own system, right? </p>

<p>The question is - how should I design the system to achieve my goals described above? </p>

<p>I would also like to stress that the products that will be listed on my website will be from different merchants. I won't be listing my own products. Merchants list their own products just like on Groupon.com.</p>

<p>Is it feasible to generate coupon codes instead of having merchants input their codes? Wouldn't that mean that they would have to also support these codes on their own systems? Like If jcpenny.com inputs products on my website, I could generate coupon codes for these products, but what if jcpenny.com does not support these coupon codes? I am guessing that Merchants would want to input their own codes... Or maybe I am wrong? </p>

<p>Now when I try one of the European countries feed with exactly the same code, I cannot print any results and I have the following error: Error: Cannot create object.</p>

<p>For the EU, The feed URL can be found on the EU Groupon site - see: <a href=""https://partner-int-api.groupon.com/help/deal-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https://partner-int-api.groupon.com/help/deal-api</a> (Scroll down to ""Location Sample Calls"").</p>

<p>See below my PHP code to print the results from the IE feed in XML, this does not work while the code is exactly the same as the US above, what's strange is that it works in Xampp, and it also works if you call the IE feed URL in a browser. But I can't print any results when I put that piece of code below on my server and call it in my browser while it works fine with the US. </p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

"Get Groupon Deals by tag using Groupon API","<p>I am playing around with the Groupon API and I would like to get a list of deals based on a specific tag. </p>

<p>Using the www.apigee.com console, I am doing a GET request on this URL:
<a href=""https://api.groupon.com/v2/deals.json?division_id=new-york&amp;tag=Arcade&amp;client_id="" rel=""nofollow"">https://api.groupon.com/v2/deals.json?division_id=new-york&amp;tag=Arcade&amp;client_id=</a>{myId}</p>

<p>However, the response I am getting appears to just be all the deals for that division (In this case, New York).</p>

<p>Here is a link to the relevant API documentation:

"Import user accounts data from other websites with user sign-in","<p><a href=""http://dealsgoround.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dealsgoround.com</a> and <a href=""http://citypockets.com"" rel=""nofollow"">citypockets.com</a> access user accounts and their daily deals from <a href=""http://livingsocial.com"" rel=""nofollow"">livingsocial.com</a> and other daily deal websites. These websites ask users to give their credentials to sign them in to respective websites and then import account details. LivingSocial and other deal website don't provide API access to user accounts.</p>

<p>I also want such access to other websites and import data from there. But I am unable to find out the backend process by which <a href=""http://dealsgoround.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dealsgoround.com</a> and <a href=""http://citypockets.com"" rel=""nofollow"">citypockets.com</a> import data from Groupon and LivingSocial etc.</p>

<p>By now I am able to find out that web crawlers/spiders can be used to scrap data from web pages. But I am not sure web crawlers can be useful in a scenario where we need user sign in and the page urls are encrypted or at least are dynamically generated urls.</p>

<p>Please help me and suggest me a way to do this. If crawlers are the solution to this please provide links to some web crawler APIs that I can use in my .net application.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
